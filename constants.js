2 Microsoft's brand voice: Simple, straightforward, and human
There s what we say, our message. And there s how we say it, our voice. Microsoft's brand voice is simple, straightforward, and human.
2.1.1.1 What do we mean by voice?
The Microsoft voice is how we talk to people. It s the interplay of personality, substance, tone, and style.
Though our voice is constant regardless of who we re talking to or what we re saying, we adapt our tone from serious to empathetic to lighthearted to fit the context and the customer's state of mind. 
2.1.1.2 Three voice principles 
Our voice hinges on crisp simplicity. Bigger ideas and fewer words. Less head, more heart. 
Our voice is:
* Warm and relaxed We re natural. Less formal, more grounded in real, everyday conversations. Occasionally, we re fun. (We know when to celebrate.)
* Crisp and clear We re to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all.
* Ready to lend a hand We show customers we re on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time.
2.1.1.3 One brand, one voice
Microsoft interacts directly with more than a billion customers worldwide. So it s crucial that our voice be distinctive yet consistent. Our unified voice sets us apart in a crowded marketplace and helps us communicate as one Microsoft to each customer, wherever we meet.
2.1.1.4 A focus on the customer
Our voice is the true reflection of Microsoft culture and our commitment to empowering people to achieve more. Talking to our customers in a way that s warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand makes them feel important, listened to, informed, and respected.
2.1.1.5 Style tips
A few key elements of writing in Microsoft s voice:
* Get to the point fast. Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don t get in the way.  
* Talk like a person. Choose optimistic, conversational language. Use short everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization. Shun jargon and acronyms. And never miss an opportunity to find a better word. 
* Simpler is better. Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Step it out. Layer. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune every excess word.

3 Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice
Use bigger ideas, fewer words
Our modern design hinges on crisp minimalism. Shorter is always better. To learn more, see Brand voice.
Example
Replace this: If you're ready to purchase Microsoft 365 for your organization, contact your Microsoft account representative.
With this: Ready to buy? Contact us.
 
Write like you speak
Read your text aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would say? Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words. To learn more, see Brand voice.
Example
Replace this: Invalid ID
With this: You need an ID that looks like this: someone@example.com
 
Project friendliness
Use contractions: it s, you ll, you re, we re, let s. To learn more, see Use contractions.
Example
Replace this: To help you avoid traffic, remember anniversaries, and in general do more, Cortana needs to know what you are interested in, what is on your calendar, and who you are doing things with. 
With this: To help you avoid traffic, remember anniversaries, and in general do more, Cortana needs to know what you re interested in, what s on your calendar, and who you re doing things with.
 
Get to the point fast
Lead with what s most important. Front-load keywords for scanning. Make customer choices and next steps obvious. To learn more, see Scannable content.
Example
Replace this: Templates provide a starting point for creating new documents. A template can include the styles, formats, and page layouts you use frequently. Consider creating a template if you often use the same page layout and style for documents.
With this: Save time by creating a document template that includes the styles, formats, and page layouts you use most often. Then use the template whenever you create a new document.
 
Be brief
Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word. To learn more, see Word choice.
Example
Replace this: The Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab recommends charts that are likely to represent your data well. Use the command when you want to visually present data, and you're not sure how to do it. 
With this: Create a chart that's just right for your data by using the Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab.
 
Skip periods (and : ! ?)
Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, subheadings, UI titles, and items in a list that are three or fewer words. Save the periods for paragraphs and body copy. To learn more, see Punctuation, Headings, and Lists. 
Example
Replace this:
Move a tile.
1. Press and hold the tile.
With this:
Move a tile
1. Press and hold the tile.
 
Remember the last comma
In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction. (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma.) To learn more, see Commas. 
Example
Replace this: Android, iOS and Windows
With this: Android, iOS, and Windows
 
Don t be spacey
Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons and no spaces around dashes. To learn more, see Punctuation.
Example
Replace this:  Use pipelines   logical groups of activities   to consolidate activities that are part of a task.
With this: Use pipelines logical groups of activities to consolidate activities that are part of a task.
 
Revise weak writing
Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Edit out you can and there is, there are, there were. To learn more, see Verbs and Word choice.
Example
Replace this: You can access Office apps across your devices, and you get online file storage and sharing.
With this: Store files online, access them from all your devices, and share them with coworkers.

4 Checklists
Use these checklists to review high-level guidance at a glance. For detailed guidance, see the related articles. 
To see all entries in this section, select the arrow next to Checklists.
4.1 Accessibility checklist
Microsoft creates technology that's accessible to people of all abilities. Accessible content and user experiences meet the Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS) requirements, which cover software and hardware development, web content, and other forms of content, including audio, video, animations, images, and interactive content. (The Microsoft Accessibility Standards page requires Microsoft network access.) This checklist will get you started. 
Learn more about Accessibility guidelines and requirements. 
4.1.1.1 Writing 
* Create text alternatives (alt text) for all elements other than text. 
* Follow Microsoft voice guidelines to create brief, clear, and focused content.
* Write short, descriptive link text that maps to or clearly describes the destination link. If possible, use at least two visual cues color and underline, for example to distinguish links.
* Use headings, tables, and lists to organize content logically, to emphasize key points, and to reinforce relationships between data and concepts. Always use header rows in tables. 
* Don't use directional terms (left, right, up, down, above, and below) as the only clue to location. If you must use a directional term, describe the location, too: in the title bar, for example.
* In documentation, cover all input methods and describe all supported modes of interaction, input commands, and keyboard shortcuts. 
* In procedures and instructions, use generic verbs that work with any input method. To learn more, see Describing interactions with UI.
4.1.1.2 Colors and patterns 
* Don t convey information using any single sensory cue color, sound, pattern, or otherwise. Use multiple cues, such as color, pattern, and text. 
* Don t use low-contrast or hard-to-read color combinations. Instead, follow minimum contrast standards and provide high-contrast alternatives. To learn more, see page 5 of the brand color guidelines. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
* Don t use screens or tints in art. Don't use patterns or images behind text. 
4.1.1.3 Graphics, design, and media 
* Try to keep webpage and UI design simple, within a rectangular grid.
* Design webpages to support known reading patterns.
* Support Tab key navigation in webpages and UI.
* Provide a version of each webpage without frames. 
* Avoid embedding text in images. If you do, use alt text to describe the embedded text. 
* Use alt text to describe all meaningful image elements other than text. Use NULL text for images that are decorative. If the description is too long for alt text, consider adding it to the content adjacent to the element or providing a link to a more extensive description.
* For audio and video content, provide closed-captioning, transcripts, and/or descriptions. (Video content requires both closed-captioning and audio descriptions.) 
* Provide text links in addition to image maps.
4.1.1.4 Terminology 
* Always put people before the disability. For example, refer to a person who is blind, not a blind person. 
* Use recommended terms when you describe specific disabilities or people with specific disabilities. To learn more, see the Accessibility term collection. 
 
4.2 Acronyms checklist
Although some acronyms are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term, others aren t well known or are familiar only to a specific group of customers. These tips will help you use acronyms and abbreviations in a way that s clear and meaningful. 
* Always spell out Microsoft product and feature names.
* Only use acronyms that your audience is familiar with. 
* For most acronyms, spell out the term first and include the acronym in parentheses. On subsequent mentions, you can use the acronym without spelling it out. 
* Lowercase all words in the spelled-out form of an acronym except for proper nouns.
* Don t spell out the acronym if it s listed in Merriam-Webster Dictionary or if the A Z word list says to use the acronym without spelling it out. If you re sure your audience is familiar with an acronym, it s OK to use it without spelling it out. 
* Don t introduce an acronym that s used just once unless it s needed for SEO. 
* Avoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading, unless it s a keyword that you need to place in the title or heading for SEO. 
* Use aor an, depending on how you pronounce the acronym (for example, an ISP, a SQL database). 
* Form the plural of an acronym like you would any other noun (for example, three APIs). 
* Unless an acronym refers to a person or an organization, avoid using the possessive form. 
* In content that will be machine translated, be careful with acronyms that form common English words, like RAM. They can be translated incorrectly.

Learn more about abbreviations of units of measure. 
4.3 Bias-free communication checklist
Microsoft is working to help everyone around the world achieve more. In line with that mission, use bias-free language in your content:
* Use gender-neutral or inclusive terms to refer to people. Avoid compound words containing man or men.
* Avoid gendered pronouns. Rewrite to use the second person (you), or refer to a person's role, such as employee or client.
* Use realistic examples of diverse individuals from all walks of life participating fully in activities. Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class.
* Be inclusive of job roles, family structure, and leisure activities.
* Avoid stereotypes in job roles. Refer to people of varied ethnic backgrounds and gender identities across professions.
* Focus on the person, not the disability.
* Don't use slang that could be considered cultural appropriation.
* Don't use profane or derogatory terms, such as pimp or bitch.
* Don't use culturally sensitive terms as metaphors for technology, such as demilitarized zone.
* Be careful with references and images related to cities, countries, and regions, especially disputed regions. To learn more, see the Global Readiness article library. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

* Start with an enthusiastic community, and engage employees who have expertise and interest.
* Establish submission standards, and monitor contributed content.
* Set aside time to manage your community program. 
* Consider public wikis, such as the TechNet wiki, or use a private wiki with limited participants for prerelease information. 
* In a wiki, create navigation articles to provide links to other articles and stub topics to encourage contribution. 
* Listen to the community, and adapt content in response to their feedback.
* Engage with your product, localization, and legal teams.
* Tag entries with keywords.
* Use social media to promote interesting content and encourage community contributions.

4.5 Bots and virtual agents checklist
These tips will help you write about and create bots. See also AI and bot term collection
4.5.1.1 Top tips for UX content design of bots and virtual agents
* Be clear that the customer is chatting with a bot, not a person, and explain what the bot can and can't do.
* Tailor the tone of the bot's responses (for example, serious, lighthearted, businesslike) to the context.
* Clarify and disambiguate the customer's intent when necessary.
* Use buttons and other UI structure to guide the conversation. Invite the customer into the conversation on a regular basis by asking questions or making suggestions.
* Break up messages into short, readable blocks, and make sure the bot doesn't respond so quickly that it rushes the customer.
* Make sure your bot recognizes and responds to words that customers are familiar with, like help, settings, start over,and stop.
* Accommodate alternative word order and incomplete requests.
* Make sure your bot can handle common misspellings and errors in the customer's input.
* Plan for the bot's limitations. How will the bot respond when it doesn't know the answer?
* If the bot is taking a while to process the customer's request, use the typing indicator or have the bot say, "I'm thinking."
* Plan how the bot responds when users start to play games with it for example, asking nonsense questions.
* Wrap up the conversation when the request is resolved.
* Have a plan for maintaining and evolving the bot. The plan should include knowing when it's time to retire your bot.

4.6 Capitalization checklist
In general, Microsoft style is sentence-style capitalization. 
* Always capitalize proper nouns. 
* Lowercase everything except the first word in a sentence, UI label, phrase, heading, or title (including the titles of blogs, articles, and press releases). 
* Don t capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun. 
* Use title-style capitalization for product and service names, book and song titles, article titles in citations, names of blogs, and titles of people (Vice President, for example). 
* It's OK to use title-style capitalization in tweets to set off a quoted article. 
* In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.
* Don't use all uppercase for emphasis. 
* Don't use all lowercase as a design choice.  
Learn more about capitalization.

4.7 Content-planning checklist
A little upfront planning will save you time and keep your writing focused. 
* Understand your audience: who they are, what they need, and where they look for content.
* Consider your business objectives for the content, in addition to time and budget constraints.
* Plan for a great experience across the devices customers will use to experience the content.
* Plan to help customers find the content.
* Decide what kind of content best meets the customer's needs and business objectives.
* Take steps to streamline translation and localization, if necessary.

Think about design before you start writing. 
* Stay in close touch with your designer, if you have one.
* Understand design options and limitations if you re writing blog posts or for social media.
* If you re starting from scratch without a designer, use a template. Check Brand Central if your team doesn t have a template. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) 
* For information about designing a Microsoft website, see the design and content resources on the Microsoft Website Management Center. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
* Make layout decisions before you start. If you're working on a platform with limited design choices, find out which layout works best. 
* Position content elements in the same place on every page if you can. 
Learn more about design planning.
4.9 Developer content checklist
Be warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand to your developer audience. Skip the basics, and get right to the technology and product information they need. 
4.9.1.1 Reference documentation
* Use consistent design, headings, and structure to help developers find the information they need quickly.
* Check your group's editorial style guide for specific information about documenting your product.
* In titles, use the name of the programming element, followed by the element type (for example, Clear Method). If multiple elements share the name, add a differentiator, such as the parent element name or product or technology name (for example, Device.Clear Method), to help customers find the right information in search results. 
* Include all required elements with clear and helpful details in each reference article.
* If you autogenerate reference documentation, make sure it includes all details that are important to customers and remove anything extraneous. 
Learn more about writing developer reference articles.
4.9.1.2 Code examples

* Format text elements consistently to help readers locate and interpret information more easily.
Learn more about formatting conventions for developer content.
4.10 Final publishing review checklist
Double-check your work. Every detail from facts to proper usage and placement of punctuation marks makes a difference. Clear, accurate content that s free of spelling and grammar mistakes is easy to read and builds trust in Microsoft's commitment to quality.
* Always rewrite, edit, and proofread. Even better, have someone else check your work.
* Read it out aloud, backward and forward. Potential problems and edits will jump out.
* Read only the headings or the first sentence of every paragraph. Do they tell a story?
* Frontload keywords in titles and headings.
* Eliminate every repetitive or redundant element.
* Excise adverbs (words describing how, when, and where).
* Evaluate the personality your writing should sound like a person, not a robot. Learn more about the Microsoft voice.
* Take things out. If you don t miss them, leave them out.
* If you have to read anything twice, simplify it or take it out.

4.11 Global communications checklist
Microsoft customers live and work all over the world and speak a variety of languages. This checklist will help you write content that's appropriate wherever they live and whatever languages they speak. 
If you have questions about whether writing, images, or design are appropriate for a global audience, see the full Global communications section of this guide. Or find a Global Readiness contact for your group who can help. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
4.11.1.1 Tips for global writing 
Content that's easy to read tends to be easy to localize and translate. To get started, review the checklists for grammar and parts of speech, punctuation, and word choice.

* Include optional words articles and pronouns (that and who). Include verbs in short headings for clarification.
* Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references.
* Limit your use of sentence fragments in instructions and technical information. 
* Use conventional English grammar and punctuation to improve the quality of machine translation in instructions and technical content. 
* Try to balance a friendly voice with clear, accurate English. 
* Use words ending in -ing and -ed carefully. 
* Use only common abbreviations, such as USB, that are defined in industry glossaries.  
4.11.1.2 Global visual design and scenarios 
* Use the Microsoft brand color palette and guidelines. Learn more on Microsoft Brand Central. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
* Feature simple or generic images that are familiar worldwide, such as soccer players and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, international highway signs, and everyday objects.

(This site requires Microsoft network access.)
* If you include text in graphics, make sure it's easy to edit. 
* Add descriptive alt text to online images. 
* Store art in a separate file and link to it from within a document if possible. 
* Vary the national identity of people, places, phone numbers, addresses, currency, and URL domains. If you mention real places, use the names of recognizable cities from different parts of the world. See Approved fictitious names and guidelines on CELAWeb for more sample content. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
* Avoid politics, religion, national or religious holidays, most sports, local traditions, legal and business practices, and other scenarios that vary across cultures. 
* If you're talking about technologies and standards that aren't used worldwide, say so. 
* Follow the guidelines on the Global Readiness site for maps. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
4.11.1.3 Time and place 
* Begin calendars on Mondays. 
* Use the date format month dd, yyyy. Don t use numerals to represent months.

* If you're providing contact information, make sure you provide a way to contact you from any country. Toll-free numbers might not be available worldwide. If appropriate, link to https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide. 
* If you refer to other US companies or organizations, state that they're US organizations and suggest where customers outside the United States can look for local resources. 
* Link to sites that are available and useful worldwide. 
4.11.1.5 Web and software considerations 
* Follow Microsoft Website Management Center design and publishing practices. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
* Use standard HTML tags. 
* Use simple design techniques. 
* Minimize download times, and design pages so that text loads first.

4.12 Grammar and parts of speech checklist
As creative as it is, the art of writing is governed by a set of rules with a lot of built-in flexibility. This checklist covers rules of grammar that are important in Microsoft content and how to apply them. You'll notice a preference for style and word choices that are simple, straightforward, and human. That's what makes us sound like Microsoft and helps you connect with customers.
These basic guidelines will get you started creating clear and useful content.
* Use present-tense verbs verbs that indicate the action is happening now, like is and open. Avoid will, was, and verbs ending in  ed, which indicate that text isn't in the present tense. Learn more.
* For most content, write simple statements of fact (called the indicative mood). Use direct commands (imperative mood) for procedures and instructions. Use wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions (subjunctive mood) sparingly. Learn more.
* Use active voice (where the subject performs the action) whenever you can. In passive voice, the receiver of the action is the subject. Learn more.
* Match a verb with its subject in person and number. Learn more.

Examples
The document is in the folder.
The documents are in the folder. 


* Use second person most of the time. Second person often uses the pronoun you, as though you're speaking to the customer. Learn more.
* Don't use gender-specific singular pronouns (he or she) in generic references. Instead, use you or refer to someone's role. Learn more.
* Capitalize proper nouns things like names of unique people, places, and things (products, books, organizations, and companies, for example). Check Merriam-Webster Dictionary or the A Z word list to find out whether a term is a proper noun. Learn more.
* Be careful with words ending in  ing, which can play different roles in a phrase. For example, in the phrase meeting requirements, make sure it's clear whether this is a discussion about requirements for a meeting or how to meet requirements. Learn more.
* Prepositional phrases modify something else in a sentence. For example, in The reading pane displays the content of the selected message, the phrase of the selected message modifies the content. Avoid using consecutive prepositional phrases. Long chains of prepositional phrases are hard to read and interpret. Learn more.
* Modifiers are words or phrases that modify other words or phrases. Make sure it's clear what they modify. For example, in the phrase the selected text only is modified, the word only could modify text or is modified. Rewrite as only the selected text is modified to clarify. Learn more.
4.13 Images and video checklist
Before using images in content, familiarize yourself with the guidelines for bias-free communication; accessible graphics, design, and media; and copyrights and trademarks.
* If you include text in an image file, make sure it s easy to edit the text, in case the content is localized. (Screenshots are an exception.)

4.17 Procedures and instructions checklist
In the best-case scenario, the UI is so clear and task driven that you don t need additional instructions. When the task is more complex or involves more than one UI, look for the simplest way to present it. That might be:
* A picture, an illustration, a poster, or an infographic.
* A video. 
* A single sentence.
* A numbered procedure, supplemented if necessary with pictures, videos, and links or buttons that take the customer where they need to go. 
Follow this checklist when procedures are the best way to help your customer complete a task. Use consistent text formatting see Formatting text in instructions. And always think accessibility see Accessibility guidelines and requirements to learn more. 
Learn more about procedures and instructions
4.17.1.1 Step-by-step instructions
Use numbered steps no more than seven, and preferably fewer. 
* Write a complete sentence for each step: capitalize the first word and end the sentence with a period. 
* Use imperative verb forms. 
* Consider using a heading that tells customers what the procedure will help them do. 
* Keep it short ideally, fit the whole procedure on one screen. Omit unnecessary details. Combine simple actions that occur in the same place in the UI in a single step. Include actions that finalize a step, such as selecting the OK or Apply button, in related steps.
* Make sure the customer knows where the action in the step takes place. Provide a brief phrase if you need to, such as on the Design tab,  . Or provide an introductory step to avoid any confusion: On the ribbon, go to the Design tab.
* If there s only one step, use the format you use for procedures with multiple steps, but replace the number with a bullet.
* If  your editorial style guide allows it, abbreviate simple sequences of menu interactions with right angle brackets. Don t use bold formatting for the brackets. Include a space before and after each one.
Example
Select Accounts > Other accounts > Add an account.
    Learn more about step-by-step instructions. 
4.17.1.2 Interactions with UI

* Most of the time, use input-neutral verbs to describe interactions with UI. See Describing interactions with UI to learn how. 
* For accessibility, always document keyboard procedures, even if they're indicated in the UI by underlined letters.
* If you need to document mouse procedures, be consistent. For example, list the mouse method before the keyboard method consistently if you document both. Don t combine keyboard and mouse actions using a plus sign. For example, say hold down Shift while clicking instead of Shift+click.
* If you describe joystick interactions, assume that a mouse is a primary input device. Include joystick information in a table along with other alternative input methods. 
* Use these verbs for pen and touch input: 
Tap: Use to describe selecting something on the screen by tapping it once with a finger or pen. Don t use tap on. Don t use click. 
Double-tap: Use to describe selecting something on the screen by tapping twice in quick succession. Don t use double-tap on. Don t use double-click. 
Tap and hold: Use only if required by a program or app. Don t use touch and hold.

Flick: Use to describe moving one or more fingers to scroll through items on the screen. Don t use scroll.
* Use swipe to describe a short, quick movement in the direction opposite to how the page scrolls .
   Learn more about alternative input methods.
4.17.1.4 Multiple input methods
If you need to document multiple ways to perform a task, use one of these methods.
* List the steps in a table. Put the step numbers in the left column, and provide a separate column for each input method.
* Document the primary input method, and provide alternative instructions in parentheses or separate sentences.
* If there are alternative ways to perform an entire procedure, such as saving a file and continuing to work or saving a file and closing a program, use a table. List each alternative in the left column and instructions on the right.
* If a step has more than one option, list the options as bullets under the numbered step. 
   Learn more about multiple input methods.
4.18 Punctuation checklist

Keep it simple.
* Stick to short, simple sentences. Sentences that contain lots of punctuation tend to be complex and hard to read.

* Use an apostrophe to indicate a missing letter in a contraction (such as don t) and to form the possessive case of a noun (as in Insider s Guide). Don t use an apostrophe for the possessive of it (its) to avoid confusion with the contraction it s. Learn more.


* When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless it's a proper noun or the first word of a quotation. Learn more.
* A sentence that contains a semicolon might be complex. Try to rewrite the sentence as multiple sentences or break it into a list. Learn more.
* Use exclamation points sparingly. Save them for when they count. 
* Use question marks sparingly. Customers expect us to give them answers. Learn more.


* Place closing quotation marks:

4.25 URLs and web addresses checklist
Follow these guidelines to refer to URLs and other addresses clearly and consistently. For detailed guidance, see URLs and web addresses. 
* Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses.
Exception
To refer generally to a website or domain, such as Microsoft.com, capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently.

* Don't use words that attribute human characteristics to devices and products. Devices don't think, feel, or otherwise exhibit human characteristics.
5 A Z word list and term collections
Don t use Microsoft.com, any other web page, or product UI as a source for product and feature names, capitalization, spelling, and usage. 
Stick with these trustworthy resources, and use them in this order. 
1. Consider your group's editorial style guide to be your primary reference. 
2. Refer to the A Z word list and term collections to find Microsoft guidelines for capitalization, spelling, and usage.

To see all the available term collections, select the arrow next to Term collections.
 
5.1.1 Accessibility terms
In general, use people-first language (refer first to the person, followed by the disability). To ensure clarity and consistency, this should be the default unless you know a specific audience prefers otherwise. 
In some cases, however, identity-first language can be used, because some people and communities take pride in recognizing their disability as an integral part of their identity and feel that person-first language is marginalizing. Always make an effort to know the preferences expressed by a person with a disability or a disability community and defer to these. 
In all cases, don t use language that has offensive or insensitive connotations, such as maimed or impaired.
For more information about people-first versus identity-first language, see the Disability language and Etiquette Guide.
The following table lists examples of people-first language (preferred), identity-first language (acceptable, context-dependent), and offensive or insensitive language (never allowed).

8.1.1 AI and bot terms
Focus on the benefits or what the customer wants to do
In general, avoid talking about AI and bot technology. Instead, focus on the benefits of the technology or what the customer wants to do with it. When it's necessary to talk about the technology itself such as in content for developers or in event presentations use the terms below.  
Don't invent new terms
Before you invent a term, search the style guides and check with the applicable brand, marketing, and product design teams to find out whether a term already exists. For more information about creating new terms or using emerging terminology, see Use technical terms carefully. 
For guidance on Microsoft Copilot names and topics, please see Copilot Guidance in the Cloud + AI Style Guide.
Term
Usage
AI
To refer to the technology itself, use AI for all audiences and in most content, including blogs, websites, and email. Don't spell out artificial intelligence.

Use intelligent or intelligence to describe or talk about the benefits of AI.

Examples

To build a model, in the left pane, select AI Builder > Build.
From document translation to intelligent threat detection, AI is enhancing the productivity of more than 120 million Microsoft 365 users.
bot, chatbot, virtual agent
Use bot to refer to an app that performs automated tasks or engages with humans through a conversational interface. 

If necessary, it's OK to use chatbot to clarify that a bot uses conversation to interact with the customer or virtual agent if the bot provides customer or technical support. After that, use bot. Avoid AI bot or AI chatbot. 

Never refer to Cortana as a bot, chatbot, or virtual agent. Use personal digital assistant instead. 
conversation as a platform (CaaP)
Don t use in content for a general audience.  

OK to use if it's necessary to refer to the computing model in which two or more people or other entities exchange messages. Define the term on the first use, if necessary, to make sure the meaning is clear to your audience.  

Spell out conversation as a platform whenever possible. If the term appears often, it's OK to use CaaP after the abbreviation is introduced in parentheses. Don't capitalize as CAAP.

Don't hyphenate conversation as a platform when used as a modifier. 
conversational user interface (CUI)
Avoid the term in customer-facing communications.

OK to use if it's necessary to refer to a computing model where people interact with a system in a conversational manner, using text or voice input. Define the term on the first use, if necessary, to make sure the meaning is clear to your audience. 

Spell out conversational user interface or conversational UI on the first use. Use CUI after the abbreviation is introduced in parentheses.  
intelligent, intelligence, intelligent technology
For all audiences and in most content, use intelligent or intelligence to describe or talk about the benefits of AI.

Don't specify standard time or daylight saving time unless you're providing information about a specific event where that information matters. 

If you're referring to a time zone as a geographical area, call it a zone. 
Example in the Pacific Time zone  

Not all time zones have names, and some time-zone names are used in more than one geographical area. If you're talking about a particular place, clarify the country or reference Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Don't include spaces around the plus sign (+) or hyphen (-).

Examples
Eastern Time (UTC-5)
Eastern Time (UTC+10)
Eastern Time (Australia)
  
For time zones without names, refer to the offset from Coordinated Universal Time.

Example Alt+Ctrl+S

Don't use accelerator key, fast key, hot key, quick key, or speed key.
access key
Don't use in content for a general audience. Use keyboard shortcut instead. 

In content for developers or content about customizing the UI, it's OK to distinguish between an access key and a shortcut key. An access key is a letter or number that users select to access UI controls that have text labels. For example, the F in Alt+F. A shortcut key is a key or key combination that users select to perform a common action. For example, Ctrl+V. If you use these terms, explain the difference. 
Key Tip
In general, don't use in content for a general audience. Use keyboard shortcut instead. 

In content teaching basic skills or content for a technical audience, it's OK to use Key Tip to refer to the letter or number that appears in the ribbon when the Alt key is pressed.
key combination
Don't use in content for a general audience. Use keyboard shortcut instead.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to distinguish between a key combination (two or more keys selected simultaneously) and a key sequence (two or more keys selected sequentially). If you use these terms, explain the difference.
key sequence
Don't use in content for a general audience. Use keyboard shortcut instead.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to distinguish between a key sequence (two or more keys selected sequentially) and a key combination (two or more keys selected simultaneously). If you use these terms, explain the difference.
keypad
Use numeric keypad on the first mention. Don't use keypad by itself unless the context has been established and there's no possibility the customer will confuse the keypad with the keyboard. When in doubt, continue to use numeric keypad. 

In general, don't distinguish between the keyboard and the numeric keypad. When the customer can select two keys that look the same, direct the customer to the correct key. 

Example Select the Minus sign on the numeric keypad, not the Hyphen key on the keyboard. 

Each group must resolve any problems that this approach might cause because of how certain keyboards and keypads function.
keystroke, keypress
Don't use keypress. Use keystroke instead.
select, press, depress, hit, strike, use
Use select to describe pressing a key on a physical or on-screen keyboard. Don't use press, depress, hit, or strike.

Don't use depressed to describe an indented toolbar button unless you have no other choice.

Use use when select might be confusing, such as when referring to the arrow keys or function keys and select might make customers think that they need to select all the arrow keys simultaneously.
Example Use the arrow keys to move around the text.

Use use when multiple platform or peripheral choices initiate the same action or actions within a program. 
Example Use the controls on your keyboard or controller to run through the obstacle course.

Be specific when teaching beginning skills. 
Example To run through the obstacle course, select the Spacebar on the keyboard or pull the right trigger on the Xbox controller. 

Consider using a table to present instructions that have more than two alternatives.

Use select and hold only if a delay is built into the software or hardware interaction. Don't use select and hold when referring to a mouse button unless you're teaching beginning skills.

Global tip In some languages, the translation of email is different for noun and verb forms. If you use email as a noun, provide enough context that localizers can identify its role in the sentence. For example, write send an email, which positions email after a verb and an article, where a noun is expected. In contrast, Email used by itself as a heading could be a noun or a verb. 
Use Email at the beginning of a sentence or heading. Never hyphenate email or capitalize the m.

Don t use enable to describe making a feature, setting, or command available. Replace with specific, plain language phrases such as turn on, allow, add, or rewrite the sentence.
In product UI, use On/Off (not Enable/Disable) as labels for a switch that controls the availability of a feature or a capability in the product. Or use more specific pairs of words such as show/hide, add/remove, or allow/block.?

Avoid using prompt as a noun within product UI, as in "Write your prompt." Instead, use request as in "Try a different request."

Avoid using prompt as a noun phrase, as in "prompt field."

Do not use prompt as a verb, as in "Then prompt Copilot to write your reply."

9 Accessibility guidelines and requirements
Microsoft devices and services empower people around the globe at home, at work, and on the go to do the activities they value most. Our technology empowers people of all abilities. Accessible content and user experiences meet the Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS) requirements, which cover software and hardware development, web content, and other forms of content like audio, video, animations, images, and interactive. (The Microsoft Accessibility Standards site requires Microsoft network access.)
This section provides an overview of accessibility guidelines:
* Writing for all abilities
* Colors and patterns in text, graphics, and design 
* Graphics, design, and media
See also Accessibility term collection
To ensure that you're complying with Microsoft accessibility policies, get familiar with the following resources. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)

10 habits to create accessible content
9.1 Writing for all abilities
Microsoft style clean, simple design and crisp, clear content is easier for all readers to use, so nearly every writing recommendation in this guide will improve accessibility. Pay special attention to the following guidelines. 
9.1.1.1 Put the person first
In general, refer to a person who has a kind of disability, not a disabled person. When you must describe specific disabilities or people with specific disabilities, use approved terminology. 
9.1.1.2 Write brief, meaningful, and focused text
Be especially clear and concise in instructions for product setup, basic features, input methods, and accessibility features. 
Lead with what matters most, so readers know immediately where to focus their attention. 
Keep paragraphs short and sentence structure simple aim for one verb per sentence. Read text aloud and imagine it spoken by a screen reader.  
Use parallel writing structures for similar things. For example, use singular nouns for each top-level heading. Or, use a verb to start each item in a list.
Spell out words like and, plus, and about. Screen readers can misread text that uses special characters like the plus sign (+) and tilde (~). 
Write brief but meaningful link text. Be descriptive links should make sense without the surrounding text.  
Distinguish link text visually. Use redundant visual cues, such as both color and underline.  
Don t force line breaks (also known as hard returns) within sentences and paragraphs. They may not work well in resized windows or with enlarged text.
9.1.1.3 Use content structure and location to communicate
Emphasize important points visually and stylistically. Lists, headings, and tables reinforce relationships between concepts. Provide summary information about the table, and use concise and specific column headings.
Use heading styles instead of text formatting. Heading levels communicate the hierarchy of content.
Don t use directional terms as the only clue to location. Left, right, up, down, above, and below aren t very useful for people who use screen-reading software. If you must use a directional term, provide additional text about the location, such as in the Save As dialog box, on the Standard toolbar, or in the title bar. 
9.1.1.4 Document alternate input methods
In product documentation, document all supported modes of interaction, input commands, and keyboard shortcuts. Include mice, keyboards, voice recognition devices, game controllers, gestures, and other interaction modes. Use the Accessibility Product Template to get started. (The template requires Microsoft network access.)
Learn more 
Documenting Accessibility Features and Services in Your Product's Help System provides instructions for and links to an Accessibility Boilerplate and an Accessibility Product Template. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Describing alternative input methods
In procedures and instructions, use generic verbs that apply to all input methods and devices. Avoid verbs like click (mouse) and swipe (touch) that don't make sense with some alternative input methods used for accessibility.

Describing interactions with UI
9.2 Colors and patterns in text, graphics, and design 
Choose colors and patterns carefully. High contrast may improve readability for people who have low vision. For people with some types of color blindness, certain color combinations are difficult to distinguish. 
Don t convey information with color alone. For example, use both color and underlined text for links, and use pattern and color to differentiate information in charts and graphs. Remember that high-contrast personalization themes in Windows alter text color. 
Don t hard-code colors. They can become illegible in high-contrast themes.  
Choose color combinations with a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. Don t use low-contrast or hard-to-read color combinations, such as light green and white or red and green. See the Microsoft brand color guidelines for color combinations that meet the minimum contrast ratio.
Don t use screens or tints in art.
Don t use screened or shaded backgrounds, watermarks, or other images behind text. Reduced contrast makes text harder to read and hinders screen readers.
9.3 Graphics, design, and media
Websites need to be accessible to everyone. Websites that are accessible to people with disabilities also support customers with various browsers, settings, and devices or who use older technologies. 
In general, use clean and simple graphic design. Provide alternate ways to get the information that's conveyed by pictures, multimedia, and image maps.

For information about designing for Microsoft.com, visit the Microsoft Website Management Center site. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
9.3.1.1 Design
Keep text within a rectangular grid for visibility and ease of scanning. 
Format tables according to your team's production guidelines and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.  
If you use frames, provide alternative pages without them.  
Don t use scrolling marquees unless the customer has control over them. 
9.3.1.2 Images, image maps, and multimedia
Provide clear descriptions that don t require pictures, or provide both. Make sure the reader can get the whole story from either the picture or the written description. 
Provide brief, accurate alt text for elements other than live text, including graphics, audio, video, animations, GIFs, and pictures of text. Describe the element in a way that conveys useful information to the reader. For complex elements, link to a separate page with more details. 
Provide closed-captioning, transcripts, or descriptions of audio and video content. 
Provide text links in addition to image maps.
Plan links and image-map links to support Tab key navigation with bidirectional text. 
10 Acronyms
Acronyms and abbreviations can have an adverse effect on clarity, voice, and findability. Although some acronyms are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term, others aren't well known or are familiar only to a specific group of customers. 
10.1.1.1 Don't create acronyms from product or feature names
Always spell out Microsoft product and feature names to protect our trademarks and brand names. Exceptions require approval from CELA and your Brand Director see your group's style guide for details.
10.1.1.2 Only use acronyms that your audience is familiar with
Check your group's editorial style guide to see whether an acronym is appropriate for your content. The A Z word list also has guidelines for many common acronyms, and some acronyms are so widely used that they're in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.
10.1.1.3 If you have to use an acronym, also spell out the term for clarity
In general, include the acronym in parentheses following the spelled-out term. On subsequent mentions in the same article, page, or screen, you can use the acronym without spelling it out. 
Some acronyms, like USB, FAQ, and URL, are more well known than the spelled-out term. Don't spell out the term if the acronym is listed in Merriam-Webster Dictionary or if the A Z word list says to use the acronym without spelling it out. If you're sure your audience is familiar with an acronym, it's OK to use it without spelling it out.
Examples
Conversation as a platform (CaaP) has the potential to make booking a flight as easy as sending a text message. Developers are also looking to CaaP to make computing more accessible to users of all abilities. 
Learn how to connect a USB device to your Microsoft Surface.
10.1.1.4 Don't introduce acronyms that are used just once
If an acronym will appear only once in your content, just spell out the term. Don't introduce it in parentheses after the spelled-out version.
Exception It's OK to use both the spelled-out term and the acronym if both are needed for SEO, even if the acronym is used only once.
10.1.1.5 Be careful with acronyms in titles and headings
Avoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading, unless it's a keyword that you need to place in the title or heading for SEO. If the first use of the acronym is in a title or heading, introduce the acronym (in parentheses, following the spelled-out term) in the following body text. 
10.1.1.6 Lowercase the spelled-out term
Lowercase all words in the spelled-out form of an acronym except for proper nouns. The names of many protocols and specifications are considered proper nouns and are capitalized when spelled out.
Examples
infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
dynamic-link library (DLL)
High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)
10.1.1.7 Use a or an, depending on pronunciation
Which article (a or an) you use depends on whether you pronounce the acronym like a word or pronounce each letter.
Examples
a DLL
an ISP
a URL
a SQL database

Add s to make an acronym plural
Form the plural of an acronym like you would any other noun. If the acronym stands for a singular noun, add a lowercase s to make it plural. If an acronym stands for a plural noun, don't add an s.
Examples
three APIs
Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
10.1.1.8 Avoid the possessive form 
Unless an acronym refers to a person or an organization, avoid using the possessive form.
Examples
the IDE enhancements
the purpose of the FAQ
the CEO's blog
Global tip In machine-translated content, be careful with acronyms that form common English words, like RAM. If the acronym appears outside of the parentheses and without the spelled-out version, it might be translated incorrectly.

Don't make generalizations about people, countries, regions, and cultures, not even positive or neutral generalizations. 
Don't use slang, especially if it could be considered cultural appropriation, such as spirit animal. 
Don't use profane or derogatory terms, such as pimp or bitch.  
Don't use terms that may carry unconscious racial bias or terms associated with military actions, politics, or historical events and eras.

11.1 Militaristic language
Avoid using terms associated with violence and military actions unless you are referring to physical combat operations.
In the context of cybersecurity at Microsoft, use the following recommendations in the table of militaristic terms. 
11.2 Use this
11.3 Not this

Attack 
It s ok to use attack if there s context in front of it describing what kind of attack it is. For example, say, Early detection is critical to preventing damage from malware attacks instead of Get protection from sophisticated attacks. 
If there s no context before attack that describes what kind of attack it is, add cyber- in front of threat so it reads cyberattack, all one word, no space, no hyphen.  
Example 
Uncover and defend against advanced cyberattacks across your entire digital estate. 

Defend, defense, and defenses 
It s ok to use defend and defenses if there s context in the same sentence that makes it clear they re referring to cybersecurity. 

Examples 
Learn how to defend your cloud and on-premises workloads.
Extend your defenses across endpoints and clouds with Microsoft Security. 

External attack surface 
It s ok to use this phrase when discussing external attack surface management, external attack surface management capabilities, or the product Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management. 
Don t use the phrase external attack surface when referring to a customer s points of access that are potentially vulnerable to an attack. Use vulnerabilities, points of access, or external exposure instead. 

Threat 
It s ok to use threat if there s context in front of it describing what kind of threat it is.  
Example 
Explore an integrated identity threat and response solution. 
If there s no context before threat that describes what kind of threat it is, add cyber- in front of threat so it reads cyberthreat, all one word no space no hyphen. 

Example 
Identify and remediate cyberthreats in the cloud and on-premises. 

Threat intelligence 
It s ok to use threat intelligence if the surrounding context makes it clear it s related to cybersecurity. Don t shorten to threat intel.  

Example 
Get actionable insights into new and emerging cyberthreats with dynamic threat intelligence. 

Never use 
These terms are overtly militaristic and should never be used in the context of cybersecurity at Microsoft (though they may be used to refer to physical combat operations): 

air cover 
bomb, email bomb, mail bomb  
enemy, enemies, enemy lines 
go on the offensive 
invade, invasion

Bias-free communication 
12 Blogs and social media
More and more, we communicate with customers through blogs, communities, and other forms of social media. These forms of communication tend to be shorter, more spontaneous, and more frequent than the formal content we relied on in the past. Plus, they often allow readers to contribute. 
This section will help you manage blogs and other social media and grow communities.
* Blogs
* Communities
* Hashtags
Before you begin, read the Microsoft blogging and social media guidelines. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
12.1 Blogs
Blogs are a good way to provide customers with ongoing, regular communications from subject matter experts as well as customer stories and breaking news. If you decide to blog, be prepared to update your blog weekly. A stale blog creates customer dissatisfaction and affects your credibility. An active, credible blog invites customer comments and community promotion. Blog posts can contain text, images, and videos.
Before you blog, read the Microsoft blogging and social media guidelines. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
The following tips will help you create and maintain a fresh and interesting blog.
Blog regularly but judiciously. A good rule of thumb is at least one meaningful blog post a week. Consider a team blog to share the workload. If you don't have something useful or interesting to talk about, it's better to skip a blog than to post extraneous content.
Identify and schedule blog topics in advance. With a plan in place, you can prepare for each post and let readers know what s coming up. An editorial schedule is especially helpful for team blogs. 
Be yourself. Keep your tone friendly and informal to encourage conversation. To learn more, see Brand voice. 
Use common sense. Follow the same guidelines that you would in any interaction or communication with customers, partners, and the press. 
Respond promptly to customer comments. Customer comments can be excellent feedback for your product team. Your responses amplify customer engagement and foster a perception of transparency and responsiveness. 
Add a disclaimer to archived posts. Something like this: To the best of my [our] knowledge, this post was accurate at the time of publication, but it might not be accurate now. I [we] recommend that you search the web for a more recent source.
Tag each blog post with keywords to help readers find related posts and search for posts about topics they care about.
Use social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, to raise awareness about new posts. 
Learn more
* Blogs on the Microsoft Technical Community site
12.2 Communities
The web has evolved from a source of information to a place where people share expertise and learn from others. Customers expect to interact with digital content. 
Consider offering customers a way to provide content on your site all customers, or a few you select. If you do, establish submission standards and have a plan in place to manage content for appropriateness, accuracy, and adherence to standards. It s a good idea to contact your group's paralegal and your Global Readiness contact before launching a new community submission program. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)
There are plenty of ways for customers to contribute content, from commenting to submitting media, tips, templates, and more. Microsoft hosts community forums for many programs. They're a great way to see what s on your customers  minds. 
Most community programs have editors, content managers, or councils in place to ensure that content is appropriate, to encourage submissions and conversations, to arbitrate disagreements, and to respond to feedback. Make sure you have the time and resources to manage a community program before you begin. 
An enthusiastic community, such as a highly engaged technical community with lots of expertise to share, is a good place to start. Include employees with expertise, such as program managers, developers, marketers, support, sales, or anyone else with expertise and a vested interest.
Community content can include:
* Troubleshooting and workarounds
* Tips and tricks
* Best practices
* Interoperability information
* Scenario-based or solution-based content
* Product evaluations
* Content about preview software
* White papers
* Community or wiki lists
* Learning road maps
Wikis, such as the TechNet wiki, are a great way to collaborate with customers and your internal community on content that Microsoft might not otherwise provide. For content that can't be released yet, use a private wiki with limited participants. Start your wiki with an idea of how you'll organize the content. Most wikis don t have a standard table of contents, but you can create one or more navigation articles to provide links to other articles. 
To encourage contribution, create stub topics: partially completed topic drafts that the community can add to. Start with content that encourages contribution, such as troubleshooting or tips and tricks, and experiment from there. Make sure your product, legal, and localization contacts support your efforts, and be open to change based on community feedback. 
If tagging is available on the community platform, tag entries with keywords to help readers find related entries and search for posts about topics they care about.
Use social media to promote interesting content and to encourage community contributions.
12.3 Hashtags
Hashtags provide context and draw readers into conversations on Twitter and other social media and in Outlook. 
Follow these guidelines to use hashtags effectively and in a positive way.
Keep your hashtags short (4 to 10 characters), and make them easy to remember and easy to spell. 
Examples
#MSIgnite
#MinecraftEdu
Use hashtags that are easy to use in a sentence. Nouns work better than verbs.
Example Good morning, Atlanta! #MSIgnite starts in 1 hour!
Make it simple and straightforward. Don t overthink your hashtag or get cute or complicated. Your hashtag should be immediately understandable.
When selecting a hashtag, always check to see how others are using it. In some cases, it s helpful to use a hashtag that s already being used by others, such as #AI or #IoT, to draw readers who are interested in that topic. You might also find that a competitor or bad actor is already using a hashtag in a way that isn t ideal or positive for the Microsoft brand.

13 Bots
Bots are a broad category of apps, but the term bot is often used specifically for one type of bot that gives people a way to interact with computers conversationally. 
The term bot should always be lowercase, even when referring to a specific bot. 
Guidelines for creating this type of bot are in the following sections: 
* Virtual agents and bots 
* Cortana 
* Social chatbots (retired)
See also AI and bot term collection
Learn more 
Azure Bot Service documentation

13.1 Virtual agents and bots
A virtual agent is a type of bot that can be used to:
* Provide information and answers. 
* Complete tasks, like booking meetings or buying tickets.
Technically speaking, there are two kinds: 
* One kind is scripted. It can respond only to questions that it was programmed to understand. 
* Another uses AI, so it can understand what the customer is telling it, and its knowledge grows the more it interacts with people. 
This section includes guidelines and tips to help you create this type of bot:
* General bot guidelines
* Content strategy and structure for bots
* Writing for bots (scripting)
* Care and feeding of bots
Learn more 
Azure Bot Service documentation
13.1.1 General bot guidelines
13.1.1.1 Make the customer experience better
Before your team creates a virtual agent, chatbot, or AI assistant, make sure to get clear on how it will add value to the customer and key messages. 
This type of bot is good for tasks where it's easier to ask for what you want rather than navigate through a menu or search for keywords. But a bot isn't a human, and there are some things that it isn't suited for. 
13.1.1.2 Don't create a bot with a name and human persona
Your bot shouldn't have a person's name and human characteristics. Zo, Xiaoice, and Rinna were the only "personified" social chatbots Microsoft produced (all retired now), and we're not creating any more. 
Your bot might not need a name if it's integrated into a product. If it's standalone, give it a name that describes what it is and does and conveys that it's not a real person. 
13.1.1.3 Comply with guidelines from CELA, Accessibility, Global Readiness, and the Microsoft Privacy Standard
Bots have unique legal, accessibility, privacy, and cultural considerations. Make sure your bot complies with these guidelines: 
* Building a Bot on CELAWeb 
* Article 1774: Managing global readiness risks with conversational agents and bots on the Global Readiness website 
* Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS) 
* Microsoft Privacy Standard, including the CaaP and bot implementation rules
(These pages require Microsoft network access.)
13.1.2 Content strategy and structure for bots
13.1.2.1 Clarify intent before acting
Until you're sure your bot can reliably interpret conversational cues, it should: 
* Confirm the customer's intent: "You need to reset your password. Is that right?" 
* Clarify and disambiguate the customer's input when necessary: "OK, we'll reset your password. But first, I'd like to know more. Did you forget your password, or are you concerned that someone else has your password? You can say, "I forgot," or "My account is compromised."  
Be careful not to overdo it, though. It's better not to annoy the customer with a needless prompt unless misunderstanding the request could cause damage. 
13.1.2.2 Use buttons and other UI structure to keep users on track
* Prompt users with actionable statements and buttons to guide the conversation. 
* Offer suggestions when the bot is "confused" about what the user's request is. 
13.1.2.3 Pace the conversation carefully
* Break up messages into separate, readable blocks to make the pace of the conversation feel more natural. 
* Make sure the bot doesn't respond so quickly that it rushes the customer. Add a minimum delay if necessary.  
13.1.2.4 Accommodate alternative word order and incomplete requests
The bot should be able to recognize the customer's request, regardless of how it's phrased. 
13.1.2.5 Conclude the conversation when the request is resolved 
Mimic the sense of closure typical in human-to-human interaction by wrapping up the conversation. For example: "Is there anything else I can help you with? [No.] OK, then. Have a great day!" Having a sense of completion helps the customer feel like there's a shared goal, reinforces the positive experience, and builds confidence in using the bot. 
 
13.1.3 Writing for bots
13.1.3.1 Be friendly while helping to complete the task 
Tailor the tone of the bot's responses to the context. If it's something serious like billing or cybersecurity be empathetic but brief and straightforward. If it's a more mundane situation (like creating a new account), the tone can be more relaxed. And a bot for Xbox can be lighthearted and casual. 
See Microsoft's brand voice  
13.1.3.2 Be honest and build trust 
* Make sure users know that they're not chatting with a person. For example, have the bot introduce itself as a virtual support agent. The message can be brief research shows that customers are usually aware that they're chatting with a bot. For more information about the privacy requirements for chatbots, see the CaaP & bot implementation rules in the Microsoft Privacy Standard. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)
* Explain what the bot's purpose is and what it can and can't do. Good ways of framing the functionality are suggesting a first task or place to begin, or providing buttons or shortcuts for the most frequent tasks. 
* Admit when things get messed up. And have a plan for dealing with the situation. 
* Plan for common misspellings and errors. These don't derail human-to-human conversations, and being able to accommodate them will build the user's confidence in the bot. 
13.1.3.3 Accept and plan for the bot's limitations 
There are some questions that a bot just won't have an answer for.  
* Make it clear to the user that the bot has a very specific role. Don't imply an open-ended, "Ask me anything" role. 
* Be prepared for when the bot doesn't know the answer, and have it point the customer in the right direction. 
* Decide what conversational cues will prompt the bot to escalate to a human. At key points in the conversation, let the customer know how they can get help from a human, if they want to. 
13.1.3.4 Keep it simple, and keep it short 
Customers abandon a chat when the prompts are lengthy. To keep your writing simple and straightforward, use the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level feature in Microsoft Word or an app like Hemingwayapp.com to figure out the grade level of your scripts. In general, the lower the grade level, the better. 
13.1.3.5 Anticipate mischief 
Plan how the bot should respond when users start to play games with it for example, asking the same question over and over to test it, using offensive language, or asking nonsense questions. An appropriate response shows that the bot can be relevant and helpful, if given a chance. Humor can be effective, but be careful: a humorous response to an offensive question can backfire.  
13.1.3.6 Be a good listener 
* Invite the user into the conversation on a regular basis by asking questions or making suggestions.  
* Respond to the customer in a timely manner. If the bot is taking a while to process the customer's request, use, "I m thinking" or the typing indicator to let the customer know the bot is working on a response.  
* Boost the relevance of the bot's responses by making them specific to the context. For example, say, "Here's how you change your privacy settings," not "Here's how you do that." 
13.1.3.7 Remember whose side you're on 
The bot is working on behalf of the customer and is there to serve the customer. It's not there for Microsoft's benefit. 
13.1.3.8 Watch your pronouns: I, me, my 
* The bot uses I, me, and my to refer to itself. 
* When the customer communicates to the bot, they also use I, me, or my. Make sure those pronouns appear on buttons, links, or other elements of the bot that the user selects.  
13.1.3.9 Recognize common words 
People are familiar with words like help, settings, start over, and stop. Make sure your bot recognizes and responds to them. 
13.1.4 Care and feeding of bots
13.1.4.1 Maintain the bot and evaluate its effectiveness over time 
Have a plan for maintaining and evolving the bot. What's working and what isn't? What's your plan for phasing in new and improved features? What can be done better? How will you know when it's time to retire your bot? 
13.1.4.2 Learn from customers 
* Make it possible for people to give you feedback directly through the bot. Ask if they got what they were looking for. Give them a way to tell you what they wanted if the results weren't what they expected. 
* Label your content blocks in the flow. That way, you can identify the content blocks that users leave from the most, figure out why, and improve them. 
* Extend or improve the experience when appropriate. For example, if the customer gives positive feedback, suggest they rate the app. If the experience didn't meet their expectations, provide a link to support. 
13.2 Cortana
Cortana is a type of bot that responds to requests and questions submitted in the customer's own words to complete tasks on the customer's behalf. Cortana uses AI to "learn" so that the more you use it, the more personalized your experience will be.
When you need to describe Cortana, use personal digital assistant, not agent, virtual assistant, or intelligent personal assistant.
Outside Cortana, Microsoft isn't creating any new bot personas or personalities in the personal digital assistant category. 
For information about writing for Cortana, see Cortana personality overview in the Windows and Devices Style Guide and Writing for Cortana on the Designing AI site. (The Designing AI site requires Microsoft network access.)

Microsoft's AI vision, rooted in research, conversations 
13.3 Social chatbots (retired)
Social chatbots, also called relationship chatbots, provide people a way to chat with a digital persona to have fun and interact socially. Social chatbots have a human persona and use AI to "learn" so that interactions become more relevant and meaningful over time. 
Microsoft's former social chatbots are all now retired: Zo, Xiaoice, and Rinna. Don't create any new personas or personalities in this category. 
14 Capitalization
Microsoft style uses sentence-style capitalization. That means everything is lowercase except the first word of a sentence and proper nouns, which include our brands and product names. Microsoft has hundreds of offerings. To help customers recognize, find, and buy them, we reserve capitalization for our brand names and product names. If it s not a brand or product, it s lowercase. 
Follow these guidelines in Microsoft content:
* Use sentence-style capitalization most of the time. That means: 
o Capitalize the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as the name of a button or checkbox), or standalone phrase. 
o Capitalize proper nouns. To learn more about proper nouns, see Nouns and pronouns.
o Capitalize brand and product names (but not features and capabilities).
o Use lowercase for everything else.

* Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Rewrite sentences that start with a word that's always lowercase. 

* Don't use all uppercase for emphasis. (It's OK to use italic sparingly for emphasis.) 

* Don't use all lowercase as a design choice. Although all uppercase is used occasionally as a design element, don't use it in text.
* Don't use internal capitalization (such as AutoScale or e-Book) unless it's part of a brand name. 
* Don t capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.
* When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized.
Examples
Country/Region
Turn on the On/Off toggle.
* For information on capitalization in hyphenated compound words see Hyphens. 
Learn more To learn more about capitalization, see The Chicago Manual of Style. If you're not sure whether to capitalize a term, check your group's editorial style guide, the A Z word list, and Merriam-Webster Dictionary. 
For information about capitalization in UI, see UI text and design and for information about capitalizing UI labels in instructions, see Formatting text in instructions. To learn more about using the Segoe font in formatting and design, see Text formatting.
14.1.1.1 Sentence-style capitalization in titles and headings
Use sentence-style capitalization in most titles and headings: capitalize the first word and lowercase the rest. 
Exceptions Proper nouns, including brand, product, and service names, are always capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word after it.
Titles of blog posts, documentation articles, and press releases use sentence-style capitalization.
Examples 
Watch your favorite HD movies, TV shows, and more 
1 TB of cloud storage 
Choose the Office version that's right for you
Available for Microsoft partners and commercial and public-sector customers
Can a search engine predict the World Cup winner?
Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces
14.1.1.2 Title-style capitalization
Occasionally, title-style capitalization capitalizing most words is appropriate. For example, product and service names, blog names, book and game titles, white paper and report titles, and occupational titles preceding a person s name (e.g., Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella) require title-style capitalization. In a tweet, it's OK to use title-style capitalization to highlight the name of a quoted article.
On the rare occasions when title-style capitalization is required, follow these guidelines:

15 Content planning
Great content starts with a plan that begins with these questions.
Who is your audience? This could be broad developers, for example but defining your audience more specifically will help you refine your plan. Is your audience writing software? Apps? IT tools? Games? Are they hobbyists, full-time developers, or IT pros who write code? What development software do they use?
What do they want to accomplish? Are they deciding whether to buy your product? Setting up a new computer? Learning new software? Preparing for a migration? Struggling with a PivotTable? Planning for network security? Is their need urgent? Few customers come to us to see what s new. Understanding why they come will help you satisfy their needs.
What is your business goal for providing the content? Are you building enthusiasm for an upcoming product launch? Establishing a competitive position in the marketplace? Documenting an out-of-band release? Providing support content to accelerate migration? Although the customer s goals are paramount, every communication has a business reason, too.
Do you have time or budget constraints? If time is of the essence, content you can create quickly might be best. The budget and the availability of an agency or specialized resources, like illustrators, designers, and video producers, will help you determine what content options are realistic.
What kind of content best meets the customer's needs and business goals? If the concepts are hard to explain, video or infographics could be just the thing. If the customer is preparing for a major project, maybe they need checklists and sample project plans, or a pricing calculator. For breaking news, tweets or a strategic blog post might be the best approach. 
How will the customer find the content? What search terms will the customer use? Plan for search keyword optimization; links back to your content; and promotion through home pages, blogs, newsletters, events, third-party sites, communities, and social media if appropriate. To learn more, see Search and writing. 
Where will the customer look for information? Part of knowing your customers is understanding where they go for information. If they have a problem, they may look to product documentation, Microsoft support, or an expert community. For training, Microsoft Virtual Academy or a video platform like YouTube might be their source. For tips and tricks, maybe it s social media and blogs.
What devices will the customer use to experience the content? Laptops? Tablets? Phones? Wearable devices? Entertainment consoles? All of those? Plan for a great experience across devices the customer is likely to use. 
Will the content be translated or localized? If so, plan your content to streamline those processes and contain costs. To learn more about developing content for translation and localization, see Global communications.
How will you measure success? Do you have numeric targets for views, clicks, or downloads? Goals for mentions or backlinks? Targets for lead generation? Planning for specific objectives up front will help you create content that meets them.
With these questions answered, you can narrow your approach. For example:
* If the customer need is immediate, maybe you blog today and create a more polished article later. 

* If budget and timeline are tight, you might choose a simple text format. 

* If the audience is large and the topic complex, a short, professionally produced video might make sense.

* If content will be localized in multiple languages, graphics supported by text might meet the customer and business need at a lower cost.

16 Design planning
For marketing and communciations, design is more than a pretty face. It provides a familiar environment for content. Text length, the use of images, headings, tables, lists, and other writing choices all play a role in the quality and effectiveness of any communication. Writing with design in mind builds predictability into content, helping readers to navigate and find what they need. 
The time to think about design is before you start writing.
16.1.1.1 Consult with your design partners early
Collaborate with your designer and marketing manager or PM to develop the content strategy. 
If you re working with a designer, meet early and often. Share your outline, your preliminary drafts, this style guide, and your group's editorial style guide. Provide preliminary content early in the process so you can identify and solve issues in the design or content approach.
16.1.1.2 Start with a template
Templates provide a well thought out framework for clear and simple communication. The brand and visual consistency templates bring to content provides predictability to your readers, so they can focus on what you have to say. Taking advantage of all your template has to offer will both enhance the customer experience and streamline modifications you need to make down the road. 
* Use manual formatting sparingly. Templates take care of most formatting for you. You may need a bold or italic phrase now and then, but always use the built-in styles for headings, subheadings, bulleted lists, tables, and whatever else your template provides. 
* Use a limited number of styles. Most content needs just a couple of heading levels, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, and of course body text. Using three or fewer styles leads to more streamlined, polished-looking results.
* Don t create new styles or modify existing ones. New styles complicate design. You ll almost always find enough styles in a template to meet the needs of your communication.
* Use styles consistently for headings, tables, lists, notes, tips, and other text, throughout your communication. 
* Don t fear white space. Your template probably includes spacing for various text elements. Use it. Empty space helps the reader focus on what s important and makes text seem less daunting. Wide margins, space around graphics, and space between lines of text all improve readability and can draw attention to particular text elements especially if you use white space consistently.
If you re starting from scratch, use a template provided by the platform or site owner or your marketing team. If necessary, ask around. Brand Central provides a variety of templates for standalone documents. For information about designing a Microsoft website, see the design and content resources on the Microsoft Website Management Center. (These sites require Microsoft network access.)
16.1.1.3 Make layout decisions before you begin
If you re writing for a platform that limits your design choices, such as a blog platform or website, research proven layout choices and find out where the design is flexible.
If you have options for positioning content elements, place them in the same area on every page. Tips, procedures, blog rolls, references, definitions, and other distinct content types are easier to find when they re located consistently. 


17 Developer content
Though the content for developers and IT professionals tends to be more technical than that for a general audience, the fundamentals of the Microsoft brand voice still apply. Be warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand as appropriate for the context. After all, when they're not coding or managing solutions, developers and IT professionals are some of the very same people who play Xbox and use Office. 
Of course, it's OK to assume IT professionals and developers bring a fundamental understanding of programming concepts. So skip the basic knowledge and focus on technology-specific or product-specific information that helps them achieve their goals.  
Two types of content form the foundation of developer documentation: reference documentation and code examples. Reference documentation provides an encyclopedia of all the programming elements, such as classes, methods, and properties, that are available for writing applications. Code examples show how to use those elements. 
This section provides guidelines for creating: 
* Reference documentation
* Code examples
It also has guidelines for formatting developer text elements.
17.1 Reference documentation
Reference documentation provides details about the programming elements associated with technologies and languages, including class libraries, object models, and programming language constructs.
Consistency is essential in reference documentation. A standard article design, predictable headings and structure, and consistent wording help developers find what they need quickly. Links to articles with related information are also a common feature.
Note Information such as configuration schemas, compiler options, and error messages might not follow the guidelines described in this section. For information about documenting those features, see your group's editorial style guide.
17.1.1.1 Article titles
Use the name of a programming element (such as Clear), followed by an element type (such as Class, Method, Property, or Event). If the name is shared by multiple elements, add a differentiator, such as the parent element name or the product or technology name. Differentiators are particularly important in search results, where they help customers find the article for the correct product or element. 
Examples 
Clear method 
Device.Clear method 
Clear method (ADO)
17.1.1.2 Elements of a reference article
The table lists the information typically provided in reference articles. Not all sections appear in all reference articles. Sections vary depending on the language, product, or technology being documented.
Section
Contains
Title and description
The name of the element and a concise sentence or two describing the element. If possible, explain what the element does or represents without repeating the element name. 

Example 
MoveRecord method (ADO)
Moves the entity represented by a Record to another location. 
Declaration/syntax
The code signature that defines the element. This section might also provide usage syntax. If the technology can be used with multiple programming languages, provide syntax for each language.
Example
Record.MoveRecord (Source, Destination, UserName, Password, Options, Async) 
Parameters
If the element has parameters, provide a description of each parameter and its data type. If appropriate, indicate whether the parameter is required or optional and whether it represents input or output. Provide as much useful detail as possible. Don't just repeat the words in the parameter name or the data type.

Examples 
Source 
Optional. A String value that contains a URL identifying the Record to be moved. If Source is omitted or specifies an empty string, the object represented by this Record is moved. For example, if the Record represents a file, the contents of the file are moved to the location specified by Destination.
Destination 
Optional. A String value that contains a URL specifying the location where Source will be moved.
UserName 
Optional. A String value that contains the user ID that, if needed, authorizes access to Destination.

Password 
Optional. A String that contains the password that, if needed, verifies UserName.

Options 
Optional. A MoveRecordOptionsEnum value whose default value is adMoveUnspecified. Specifies the behavior of this method.

Async 
Optional. A Boolean value that, when True, specifies this operation should be asynchronous. 
Return value
If the element returns a value, describe the value and information about its data type. If the value is a Boolean that indicates the presence of a condition, describe the condition.

Example
A String value. Typically, the value of Destination is returned. However, the exact value returned is provider-dependent.
Remarks
Additional information about the element and important details that may not be obvious from its syntax, parameters, or return value. For example, you might explain what the element does in more detail, compare it with similar elements, and identify potential issues in its use.
Example
The values of Source and Destination must not be identical; otherwise, a runtime error occurs. At least the server, path, and resource names must differ.

For files moved using the Internet Publishing Provider, this method updates all hypertext links in files being moved unless otherwise specified by Options. This method fails if Destination identifies an existing object (for example, a file or directory), unless adMoveOverWrite is specified.

Note Use the adMoveOverWrite option judiciously. For example, specifying this option when moving a file to a directory will delete the directory and replace it with the file.

Certain attributes of the Record object, such as the ParentURL property, won't be updated after this operation completes. Refresh the Record object s properties by closing the Record, then reopening it with the URL of the location where the file or directory was moved.

If this Record was obtained from a Recordset, the new location of the moved file or directory won't be reflected immediately in the Recordset. Refresh the Recordset by closing and reopening it.

Note URLs using the http scheme will automatically invoke the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing. For more information, see Absolute and Relative URLs. 
Example
A code example that illustrates how to use the programming element. For more information about writing useful code examples, see Code examples.
Requirements or Applies to
Language or platform requirements for using the element.

Example
Record Object (ADO)
See also
References or links to more information about how to use the element. References or links to related elements.

Examples
Move Method (ADO) 
MoveFirst, MoveLast, MoveNext, and MovePrevious Methods (ADO) 
MoveFirst, MoveLast, MoveNext, and MovePrevious Methods (RDS) 
Other information can appear in reference articles as appropriate to the language, product, or technology. For example, instead of a parameter description as shown in the preceding table, there can be descriptions of members, methods, property values, and field values. The following table contains an example of a property value and examples of exceptions and permissions.
Section
Contains
Property value
A description of the value for a property or field. If the property or field has a default value, describe that, too. Include the data type of the property value if applicable.
Example
Property Value 
String  
Returns or sets a String value representing the current date according to your system. 
Exceptions/error codes
If the element can throw exceptions or raise errors when called, list them and describe the conditions under which they occur.

Example
IOException An I/O error occurred. 
ArgumentNullException format is null. 
FormatException The format specification in format is invalid. 
Permissions
Security permissions that apply to the element, if required.

Example
Requires CREATE FUNCTION permission in the database and ALTER permission on the schema in which the function is being created. If the function specifies a user-defined type, requires EXECUTE permission on the type.
If you automatically generate reference documentation and comments from the source code, review the quality and appropriateness of the comments. Developers might leave out details that are important to customers. Remove any implementation or internal details that aren't suitable for documentation. 
Learn more For other examples of technical reference articles, see the .NET API Browser section of Microsoft Docs.
17.2 Code examples
Code examples illustrate how to use a programming element to implement specific functionality. They might include:
* Simple, one-line examples interspersed with text.
* Short, self-contained examples that illustrate specific points.
* Long samples that illustrate multiple features, complex scenarios, or best practices. 
Developers use code examples to: 
* Assess a technology through its API during planning.
* Learn or explore a language or technology.
* Write and debug code.
Many developers copy example code from documentation into their own code or adapt code examples to their own needs. 
To create useful code examples, identify tasks and scenarios that are meaningful for your audience, and then create examples that illustrate those scenarios. Code examples that demonstrate product features are useful only when they address the problems that developers are trying to solve.
17.2.1.1 Guidelines for planning code examples
* Create concise examples that exemplify key development tasks. Start with simple examples and build up complexity after you cover common scenarios. 

* Prioritize frequently used elements and elements that may be difficult to understand or tricky to use. 

* Don't use code examples to illustrate obvious points or contrived scenarios. 

* Create code examples that are easy to scan and understand. Reserve complicated examples for tutorials and walkthroughs, where you can provide a step-by-step explanation of how the example works.

* Add an introduction to describe the scenario and explain anything that might not be clear from the code. List the requirements and dependencies for using or running the example.

* Provide an easy way for developers to copy and run the code. If the code example demonstrates interactive and animated features, consider providing a way for the developer to run the example directly from your content page.

* Use appropriate keywords, linking strategies, and other search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to improve the visibility and usability of the code examples. For example, add links to relevant code example pages and content pages to improve SEO across your content. See Search and writing. 
17.2.1.2 Guidelines for writing code examples
* Design code for reuse. Help developers determine what to modify. Add comments to explain details, but don't overdo it. Don't state the obvious.

* Show expected output, either in a separate section after the code example or by using code comments within the code example. 

* Consider accessibility requirements for code that creates UI. For example, include alternate text for images. 

* Write secure code. For example, always validate user input, never hard-code passwords in code, and use code-analysis tools to detect security issues. 

* Show exception handling only when it's intrinsic to the example. Don't catch exceptions thrown when invalid arguments are passed to parameters. 

* Always compile and test your code. 
17.3 Formatting developer text elements
Consistent text formatting helps readers locate and interpret information. Follow these formatting conventions for text elements commonly used in content for developers. 
For information about referring to UI elements, see Formatting text in instructions. 
Your group's editorial style guide might include additional conventions.

18 Final publishing review
Use these tips to help you edit like a pro, so your final content and design shine. 
Hit the mark. Review the project brief and customer insights one last time. Did you nail the objective? Is the value proposition front and center? Are key messages and benefits clear? 
Get a second opinion. Find someone completely removed from the work to offer feedback and act as the customer. (Or hire an editor.) No matter how well you write, a second set of eyes always offers a new perspective. And don t take suggestions personally keep an open mind and be flexible to new ways to get the results you want. If something trips up your reviewer, get rid of it, no matter how much you like it.
Read your work aloud. Read it forward, and then backward one sentence at a time. It may sound silly, but potential edits will jump out.
Read only the headings, and then only the first sentence of every paragraph. Do they tell a story? Are there gaps? Repeated ideas?
Check for keywords in titles and headings. Titles and headings help readers scan and help search engines find your content. Make sure you include relevant keywords in the first few words. While you re at it, read your first sentence to see if it will make sense as a search engine description. To learn more, see Search and writing.
Search for and remove unnecessary and redundant elements. Try removing words, sentences, paragraphs, headings, even entire sections. If you don't miss it, leave it out. It s good for your opening paragraph to summarize the piece at a high level. But don t repeat phrases verbatim, or include tips or notes found later in the text.
Pay attention to the spell checker. Those squiggly lines will help you eliminate a lot of errors. But spell checkers can't think. It s up to you to check each suggestion. Otherwise you might end up saying manger where you meant manager. 
Cite quotations and references. See Using quotes in advertising and marketing to learn how. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Keep it legal. Refer to company and product names correctly and make sure your content complies with legal requirements. If you include examples or scenarios, use the fictitious content provided on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) To learn more, see Legal content.
Take a break. Leave the finished piece alone for a day. Read it again tomorrow you may see things you missed. 
Evaluate the voice and personality. Before you call it done, read it one final time. Can you hear the fresh and modern Microsoft voice? Your writing should sound warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand.
 
 
19 Global communications
Microsoft customers live and work all over the world and speak a variety of languages. This section will help you write content for worldwide communication. If you have questions that aren't answered here about whether writing, images, or design are appropriate for a global audience, use the Global Readiness contacts page to find an expert who can help. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
It's usually safe to assume your content will be read in many countries and by readers whose primary language isn't English. Some content will probably be translated into other languages or localized.  
Translation is simply changing the language of content. Translation is often automated using machine translation.
Localization is the process of adapting a product or content (including text and other elements) to meet the language, cultural, and political expectations and requirements of a specific local market (locale). Localization is done by people who are familiar with the local language and culture.
This section provides guidelines for supporting worldwide customers who use English content and for streamlining localization and machine translation. You'll find a few exceptions to general Microsoft voice and style guidance. This section covers:
* Art
* Currency
* Examples and scenarios
* Legal considerations
* Names and contact information
* Time and place
* Web, software, and HTML considerations
* Writing tips
For Microsoft's approach to localizing product names, see the Brand Central name localization guidelines. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
19.1.1.1 Learn more about worldwide audiences
Be curious. If you write for audiences in particular countries or regions, subscribe to local email newsletters, visit local websites, and follow local news.

19.2.1.1 Color
Choose carefully. Colors may have religious, cultural, or political significance, particularly colors used on flags or for country- or region-specific holidays. Neutral and brand colors are usually OK. Your international program manager can provide guidance.

Choose simple or generic images that are appropriate worldwide. Soccer players and equipment, generic landscapes and settings, pens and pencils, international highway signs, and historic artifacts are appropriate images worldwide.
* Avoid holiday or seasonal images. 
* Avoid major landmarks and well-known buildings, which may have legal protections or be associated with politics or religion. 
* Social or work situations involving men and women are risky in a few locales. 
* Don t use hand signs. 
* Don t use art based on English idioms.
Limit graphics and animations online. In some countries or regions, long page-loading times can be expensive.
If you use text in graphics, make sure it's easy to edit. Automatic translation software won t translate it. If possible, use captions or describe the graphic in text, instead. 
Create descriptive alt text for images, especially button images, which readers may not understand. 
Store art in a separate file and link to it from within a document if possible. Localizers can modify art that isn t embedded in the document. 
Verify that Microsoft has worldwide distribution rights for any art you use, and make sure you remove art from websites before the licenses expire. Worldwide distribution may affect royalties.
Find out whether the copyright statement will protect art anywhere it s seen. 
Check restrictions on imported content in countries or regions where the content will be used. Be especially careful with maps, which may be subject to government review. Improper treatment of a disputed area may be illegal in some countries. All maps should follow the guidelines on the Global Readiness site. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
19.3 Currency
19.3.1.1 Currency names
In general, lowercase the names of currencies, but capitalize the reference to the country or region. 
Examples
US dollar 
Canadian dollar
Hong Kong SAR dollar
Brazilian real
South African rand
Pricing through the Microsoft Online Subscription Program is shown in US dollars.
In a structured list, for example a table that compares available pricing options, it's OK to capitalize the name of the currency.
Example

19.3.1.2 Specific monetary amounts
When you're referencing specific amounts of money, use the currency code, followed by the amount, with no space.
Example The company generated BRL2.89 billion (USD1.42 billion) in net revenue in 2015. 
If it's clear which currency you mean, it's OK to use just the symbol. When referring to a specific amount in euros, use the euro symbol ( ), not the word euros.
Examples
One of the largest companies in the United States, Adatum Corporation generated $1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015. 
Adatum Corporation generated  1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015. 
19.3.1.3 Official currency names and codes
Use the names and codes listed on the Regional Formats page on the Global Readiness website. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
To find a currency name or code:
1. Select a locale, and then select Search.
2. Expand the Currency section, and look for the English Currency Name or International Currency Code.

19.4 Examples and scenarios
Fictitious examples that include the names of people, places, or organizations are potentially sensitive, both legally and from a worldwide perspective. Use-case scenarios detailed descriptions of specific customer interactions with a product, service, or technology present similar problems. Ask your international program manager and your group's paralegal to review examples and scenarios. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) To globalize examples and use-case scenarios, use these guidelines.
Use CELAWeb to obtain example content such as organization and personal names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, currency, and URLs. You might need to include a disclaimer noting that any similarity to real people, places, or things is coincidental. See the following pages on CELAWeb for more information. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)
* Approved fictitious names and guidelines
* Approved company names and URLs
* Fictitious names finder
* Guidance for using fictitious content
* Criteria for new fictitious content
Be sensitive to how use-case scenarios may be perceived in other cultures. Social situations, politics, religion, events, holidays, sports, traditions, and legal and business practices vary worldwide. For example, greeting cards are uncommon in many parts of the world, and in some cultures men and women don t touch in public, even to shake hands.
Avoid mentioning real places altogether, or use the names of recognizable cities from different parts of the world. Vary the locales from one example to the next. 
Avoid discussing technologies and standards that aren't used worldwide. Standards vary, from phone, mobile, wireless, and video to measurement, paper size, character sets, and text direction. And don t assume US standards are familiar or relevant to everyone. 
19.5 Legal considerations
Content is subject to the laws of the countries where it's distributed. The laws governing product documentation, advertising, sales promotion, and other kinds of content vary significantly from one country or region to the next. Marketing statements and political statements are restricted by law in some countries and regions. 
Always check with your group's paralegal to verify that you re complying with the laws where the content will be distributed. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
This section covers some important areas where US and international law may affect content.

If you still have questions, contact your group s paralegal. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
 
19.5.1.1 Discounts and special offers
Include any limitations on availability of the offer. For each country or region where the offer is valid, provide price information in the local currency and mention any taxes that apply.
19.5.1.2 Events, products, contests, and special offers
Review the Promotions page on CELAWeb. All contests and sweepstakes must be approved by the CELA Promotions team. (These pages require Microsoft network access.) 
Specify where events, products, contests, and special offers are available. Use only to exclude any place not mentioned specifically. State where items can be shipped, and note any additional charges, including international shipping.  
State an expiration date, if there is one. If the offer is limited to available inventory, say so.  
If release dates or events differ by country or region, link to a list of release dates or provide information that can be customized based on the customer s location.  
Include contact information for customers outside of the United States, or include a link to https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/.
19.5.1.3 Standard legal language
Include legal statements that are required in specific countries and regions. Always check with your group's paralegal to verify that your legal statements comply with corporate policies and all applicable laws. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) CELA can help you determine what you must do to comply with internet, copyright, privacy, and business laws in various countries and regions. 
19.5.1.4 Privacy laws
Understand the local laws regarding notification and the collection, storage, use, sharing, and retention or destruction of personal information before you collect it. Adhering to the Security and privacy guidelines on CELAWeb is the surest way to comply with privacy laws worldwide. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
19.5.1.5 Copyrights and trademarks 
In web content, include a link to copyright and legal information that can be updated for specific countries or regions. If you re using trademarks or trademark symbols in content, follow CELA guidance.
Learn more about copyrights and trademarks:
* Copyrights and trademarks in this guide
* Protecting our content on CELAWeb (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
When in doubt, check with your group's paralegal. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
19.5.1.6 Product claims
Don t compare one product with another. If you must do this, send your comparisons to your group's paralegal for review, along with a description of your substantiation for the comparative claim. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) Some countries and regions have strict requirements of documented proof for such comparisons. Others require the permission of the competitor. Still others restrict specific comparisons such as more clip art than Brand X (where Brand X is a named product).
Don t use superlatives, such as the world's fastest database. It s OK to compare your product with earlier versions of the same product, such as our fastest version yet.
Ensure that third-party recommendations and testimonials are provided willingly. Paid endorsements are illegal in some countries and regions. Testimonials require permission. Always get a signed quote permission form. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Learn more about product claims and comparisons on CELAWeb. (The following pages require Microsoft network access.)
* Comparative advertising guidelines 
* Substantiation for advertising claims 
* Endorsements and testimonials guide
When in doubt, check with your group's paralegal. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
19.5.1.7 Media ratings
Include the media ratings required in the countries and regions where your product will be distributed. For example, game software and hardware may require an epilepsy warning in some countries and regions. Check with your group's paralegal if you re not sure about the laws in countries and regions where your product will be distributed. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
19.5.1.8 Restrictions on names of places and landmarks
Don t refer to countries, regions, cities, or land features that are in disputed areas or show them on maps. Use the PoliCheck tool to check text for problematic names and terms. (This tool requires Microsoft network access.) Errors in the names or boundaries of disputed territories may be offensive or even illegal in some countries and regions. 
Learn more See the official country/region list on the Global Readiness website. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
19.5.1.9 Legal use of third-party content
In most cases, using photographs, artwork, videos, music, or other content from a third party requires a specific license or permission. Some publications require permission or payment to link to or quote from an article. Reproducing copyrighted content requires permission at the very least. Before you distribute third-party content in a country or region, check the following:
* Make sure the third-party license includes worldwide distribution.

* Determine whether worldwide distribution affects royalty payments.

* Check the license expiration date, and plan to remove the content before the license expires.

* Verify that the copyright statement protects the content anywhere it may be seen.

* Check for restrictions on imported content in countries or regions where your product or website is likely to be seen. Maps, for example, are often subject to government review before they can be imported.

* Before using clip art that s readily available on public (or Microsoft internal) websites, verify that the license covers your use.
Before quoting, citing, linking to, or using copyrighted content from third parties, check with your group's paralegal. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) When you do use third-party content, make sure you have permission for your specific use, quote it exactly, and include the required citations, which vary by type of content and across content sources.
 
 
 
19.6 Names and contact information
19.6.1.1 Forms that collect information
If you're creating a real or sample form that collects personal information, use these guidelines. And adhere to the Privacy and security guidelines on CELAWeb when you collect personal information. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) Many countries strictly control what personal information can be legally collected, stored, and shared. Before collecting personal data outside the United States, check with your international program manager and your group's paralegal. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Names
* Use First name and Last name in forms, or simply Full name. 

* If you include a Middle name field, make it optional. 

* Use Title, not Honorific, to describe words such as Mr. and Mrs. Not all cultures have equivalents to some titles used in the United States, such as Ms.
* Refer to Article 1708: Personal name formats on the Global Readiness website for the correct ordering of first and last names in various cultures. The article also has guidelines for using the personal name formats available on the Regional Formats page. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
Addresses
* Provide fields long enough for customers to include whatever information is appropriate for their locale. 

* Use State or province instead of State. Fields that might not be relevant everywhere, such as State or province, should be optional. 

* Use Country or region instead of just Country to accommodate disputed territories. It's OK to use Country/Region if space is limited.

* Include a field for Country or region code if you need information for mailing between European countries or regions. It's OK to use Country/Region code if space is limited.

* Use Postal code instead of ZIP Code. Allow for at least 10 characters and a combination of letters and numbers. 

* Provide enough space for long phone numbers. 
19.6.1.2 Communications that use the customer's name 
It's not appropriate in some markets and cultures to address the customer by name for example, in an email or product home page.  
If you're working on content that addresses the customer by name, check with your team to confirm that the app can reliably determine what region the customer is in and can use the form of address that's appropriate for that market. 
For the correct ordering of first and last names in various cultures, see Article 1708: Personal name formats on the Global Readiness website. This article also has guidelines for using the personal name formats available on the Regional Formats page. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) 
19.6.1.3 Contact information for Microsoft and third parties
* If you're providing information about how to contact Microsoft, remember that toll-free telephone numbers aren't always available worldwide. Provide an alternate way for customers to contact Microsoft. If appropriate, link to https://www.microsoft.com/worldwide.

* Avoid references to third-party companies and organizations in the United States. In particular, avoid referring customers to US resources. If you must provide a vendor, supplier, or retailer reference, state that it's a US company or organization, and suggest where customers outside the United States can look for local resources.
 
19.7 Time and place
Use the following guidelines when talking about time and place.
19.7.1.1 Dates
* Begin calendars on Mondays, which is the custom in much of the world. 
* Use the date format month dd, yyyy. Don t use numerals to represent months. For example, use January 5, 2018.
19.7.1.2 Time
* Include the time zone when it matters to customers, such as in an event listing. In time stamps that automatically display the customer's local time, you don't need to include the time zone.
19.7.1.3 Seasons
* Don t refer to seasons if you can avoid it. Talk about months or calendar quarters instead. If you must mention a specific season, establish the hemisphere, too. (Summer in the northern hemisphere is winter in the southern hemisphere.)
19.7.1.4 Places
* In event locations, include the country or region name. 
* Don t name countries, regions, cities, or land features in disputed areas or show them on maps. Use the PoliCheck tool to check text for problematic names and terms. (This tool requires Microsoft network access.) For more information, see the Official Country/Region List on the Global Readiness website. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

19.8 Web, software, and HTML considerations
Web content attracts a worldwide audience. When you develop websites, keep in mind that customers may not have the latest browsers, broadband internet access isn't available everywhere, and internet service providers don't always charge a flat monthly rate for access. Follow these guidelines to support customers around the world.
19.8.1.1 Support a variety of browsers and experiences
Follow Microsoft Website Management Center design and publishing practices. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
Support browsers likely to be used by worldwide audiences. To support earlier versions of browsers, you might need to:
* Provide a no-frames version.  

* Avoid certain elements in scripts.  

* Include some design information (such as background color) in the document files instead of the style sheet.  

* Avoid nested tables.

* Test using a variety of browsers and versions. 
Use Segoe fonts, which are available in browsers and operating systems worldwide. Design content so fonts will be substituted if the specified font isn't available. Avoid hand-drawn fonts and fonts that are hard-coded in text or code.
Use standard HTML tags, not proprietary tags. If you re developing HTML text with scripted code, globalize text that s generated by the scripts, too.
Use the simplest possible design solutions.
19.8.1.2 Minimize download time
Keep pages as small as possible, and include text-only versions for larger content. Internet service charges still vary greatly by locale and access method.
Design pages so text loads first, followed by graphics, so pages are usable before they're finished loading. 
19.8.1.3 Support multiple languages
Support reading from right to left or from top to bottom. For example, provide key information, such as home page links, at both the upper-right and upper-left sides of the page. 
Allow space for text expansion due to localization. 
19.8.1.4 Comply with US and local laws as well as software availability
Follow laws pertaining to software restrictions. Pay particular attention to downloads and multiproduct DVDs. 
* US law restricts the international delivery of certain information and technology. Verify that the download complies with US law.

* Be aware of local download restrictions. The distribution of marketing statements; political statements; and the names of people, places, and landmarks is restricted by law in some countries and regions. Verify that the download is legal in the country or region.
Verify availability. Some products and formats aren't available worldwide. Localized versions of new and updated products and formats may lag behind US availability. 
19.8.1.5 Globalize links
Link only to sites that are available and useful worldwide.
Link to a site where the reader can specify the appropriate country or region, if possible.
Identify links and cross-references that aren t globally relevant. If you must link to a site or refer to a publication that s not globalized, inform your readers.
19.8.1.6 Know where your email is going
Monitor subscriptions to your newsletter to determine the reader's location. Newsletters emailed to people outside the United States must be globalized, localized, or customized to meet local requirements.
19.9 Writing tips
Content that s easy to read tends to be easy to localize and translate. If you follow the writing recommendations in this style guide, you re off to a great start. Pay particular attention to:
* Word choice
* Grammar and parts of speech
* Punctuation
19.9.1.1 Tips for all global content
These practices help both localizers and customers.
Write short, simple sentences. Punctuating a sentence with more than a few commas and end punctuation usually indicates a complex sentence. Consider rewriting it or breaking it into multiple sentences. 
Replace complex sentences and paragraphs with lists and tables.
Include that and who. They help to clarify the sentence structure. 
Examples 
Inspect the database to verify that all tables, data, and relationships were correctly migrated.
Select the checkbox of each folder that you want to sync with your desktop.
Include articles, such as the. Articles help readers and translation software identify the nouns and modifiers in a sentence. 
Examples 
Empty the container. 
The empty container
If necessary for clarity, include verbs in short headings and UI labels. For example, say Access is denied instead of Access denied.
Use sentence-style capitalization. Capitalize proper nouns only, including trademarks and the names of products. 
Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references. They can be confusing for non-native English speakers and hard to localize. Consider the worldwide implications of what you write. Customers in other locales may not know much about the history and culture of your country. 
Avoid modifier stacks. Long chains of modifying words are confusing even to native English speakers. For example, say "Your migration will proceed more smoothly if you have a project plan that's well thought out," not "With an extremely well thought-out Windows migration project plan, your migration will go more smoothly."
Use active voice and indicative mood most of the time. Use imperative mood in procedures.
Keep adjectives and adverbs close to the words they modify. Pay particular attention to the placement of only.
Avoid linking more than three phrases or clauses by using coordinate conjunctions such as and, or, or but. Better yet, avoid linking more than two. 
19.9.1.2 Additional tips for machine translation
Writing style affects the quality of machine translation. These tips will help you write text that's more likely to be translated accurately by machine translation. Follow these guidelines for technical content, instructions, white papers, and other content that has high business value but won't be localized.
Use conventional English grammar and punctuation. Try to balance a friendly voice with clear, accurate English.
Use simple sentence structures. Write sentences that use standard word order (that is, subject + verb + object) whenever possible.
Use one word for a concept, and use it consistently. Avoid using synonyms to refer to the same concept or feature. And don t use the same word to refer to multiple concepts or features.
Limit your use of sentence fragments. Sentence fragments can be hard to translate.
Use words ending in  ing carefully. A word ending in  ing can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun. Use the sentence structure and optional words to clarify the role of the  ing word.
Use words ending in  ed carefully. A word ending in -ed can be a modifier or part of a verb phrase. Use the sentence structure and optional words to clarify the role of the  ed word.
* Add a determiner (a, an, the, this) before or after the  ed word. 
Example
They have an added functionality. 

* Add a form of the verb be. 
Example
Configure limits for the backup that are based on the amount of storage space available.

* Split the sentence in two. 
Example
Configure limits for the backup. These limits should be based on the amount of storage space available. 

* Rewrite the sentence to avoid the  ed word. 
Example
Configure limits for the backup. Base the limits on the amount of storage space available.
Use only common abbreviations, such as USB, and abbreviations that are defined in glossaries. Check with a localization expert to find out if an acronym is defined. 
20 Grammar and parts of speech
Simple grammar tends to be easy to read and understand, like a conversation. That basic grammar you learned before you were 12 is probably just right for most Microsoft content. 
This section covers common grammatical issues:
* Verbs 
* Person 
* Nouns and pronouns 
* Words ending in  ing 
* Prepositions 
* Dangling and misplaced modifiers 
Learn more For more information about grammar and parts of speech, see The Chicago Manual of Style. 
20.1 Verbs
 Using precise verbs in the right way helps you write clear and simple sentences.
20.1.1.1 Verb tense
In the present tense, the action is happening now. The present tense is often easier to read and understand than the past or future tense. It s the best choice for most content. 
Examples 
The Windows Start screen is uniquely yours, personalized with your favorite apps, people, photos, and colors. 
Windows Update installs important updates automatically.
20.1.1.2 Mood of verbs
The mood of a verb expresses the writer s intent. Most of the time, use the indicative mood. It s crisp and straightforward without being bossy. Don t switch moods within a sentence.
Mood
Use for
Examples
Indicative
Statements of fact, questions, assertions, and explanations most Microsoft content.
Style sheets are powerful tools for formatting complex documents.
Imperative
Instructions, procedures, direct commands, requests, and headings for columns that list customer actions.
Enter a file name, and then save the file.
To do this       Select this
Subjunctive
Wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions avoid.
We recommend that you be careful about opening email attachments.
 
Active and passive voice
Voice is either active or passive. Keep it active whenever you can.
* In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. 
* In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.
Voice
Uses
Examples
Active
Most Microsoft content
Divide your document into as many sections as you want. 
Office 365 includes the Office 2016 apps for PC and Mac.
Passive
* Avoiding condescending text or blaming the customer, especially in errors, warnings, or notifications
* Avoiding awkward constructions
* Emphasizing the receiver of the action
That site can't be found. Double-check the site address in the Address bar. 
When the user clicks OK, the transaction is committed. (in content for developers) 
20.1.1.3 Verb agreement
Verbs have singular and plural forms. Use the verb form that agrees with the subject of the sentence in number. 
When the subject is
The verb is
Examples
A group of things
Singular
A variety of games is available from Microsoft Store. 
Two or more singular things connected by and
Plural
Facebook and Twitter are available from Microsoft Store. 
Two or more singular things connected by or
Singular
Your tablet or phone is all you need to play your favorite games on the go. 
A singular thing and a plural thing connected by or
Singular or plural, to match the closest subject
Skype or social media apps are available from Microsoft Store.
Social media apps or Skype is available from Microsoft Store.
20.2 Person
In grammar, person refers to the point of view represented by a statement and determines which pronoun to use. 
In general, use second-person pronouns (you, your)
In second person, you write as though you're speaking to the reader. The second person often uses the personal pronoun you or your, but sometimes the word you is implied. It supports a friendly, human tone and helps avoid passive voice by focusing the discussion on the reader. Omit you can whenever the sentence works without it. 
In product UI, avoid using you and your in ways that sound like we're commanding people to do something rather than providing options for them to make their own choices.
However, when AI-generated content is used, we should use past tense (to express action done behind the scenes) by explicitly saying  for you  or by using words that convey uncertainty or subjectivity (to express that a judgment was applied that may or may not be correct).
Examples
 
Check if you have local admin rights.
Depending on your choice, some features may be turned off by default. 
Change your settings
Suggested for you
 
Use singular first-person pronouns sparingly (I, me, my)
In first person, you write as though you re speaking from the reader s point of view. Marketing and support documentation should never use first person singular. However, it may be used inside our product experiences. First-person singular pronouns can be used in product UI to show someone s control over an action in checkbox, button, or toggle labels. 
Examples
Notify me when a new Bluetooth device tries to connect to my computer
Remember my password
I agree to the terms of service
Exception In rare cases, it s OK to use  my  in navigation or filter labels if you need to distinguish a person s content from other content that may be presented in the same visual space.

Exception Cortana is a persona, so the use of I is appropriate. For information about writing for Cortana, see Voice in the Windows and Devices Style Guide.
Avoid plural first person (we, us)
First-person plural, which often uses the pronoun we, can feel like a daunting corporate presence the opposite of Microsoft's modern voice. It's OK to use phrasing like we recommend if it helps you avoid awkward phrasing like it's recommended, but write around it if you can. Try to keep the focus on the customer, not Microsoft. It s OK to use we in privacy and security settings where you need to make clear Microsoft is the speaker.  
Examples
Notify scheduled default setting is the easiest way to keep your computer up to date. (Instead of We recommend that you use the scheduled default setting ....)
Change your password (Instead of We recommend that you change your password.) 
We protect your privacy at every step. 
That didn t work. Try again. (Instead of We weren t able to run the Solution Checker. Try running it again.)

20.3 Nouns and pronouns
20.3.1.1 Capitalization and proper nouns
Proper nouns are one of a kind unique people, places, and things. Capitalize proper nouns wherever they occur. 
Proper nouns include:
* Names and titles of individuals.
* Unique, named places, organizations, events, shows, corporate and philanthropic programs, and other things.
* Product, service, app, and tool names.
* Trademarks.
* Titles of books, songs, and other published works.
* Managed standards, such as Bluetooth.
If there's more than one of a thing, it's a common noun. For example, there are lots of chief operating officers, so chief operating officer is a common noun. There's only one Chief Operating Officer Latasha Sharp, so that's a proper noun.
Don't capitalize common nouns unless they begin a sentence, or the situation calls for title-style capitalization. Most technology concepts, product categories, devices, and features are common nouns, not proper nouns. Examples of common nouns include cloud computing, smartphone, e-commerce, and open source. 
Capitalize technology terms as proper nouns only when:
* You need to distinguish a component or product, such as SQL Server, from a general technology with a similar name, such as an SQL database server.
* The terms are typically capitalized in the industry. Search Merriam-Webster Dictionary, reputable internet sites, and industry-specific dictionaries. Don't rely on unedited websites. 
If you're not sure whether a term is a proper noun (and thus capitalized) or a common noun (lowercase), check Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the A Z word list, and your group's editorial style guide. Default to lowercase unless there's a compelling reason to capitalize the term.
Learn more For guidelines for sentence-style and title-style capitalization, see Capitalization.
20.3.1.2 Plural nouns
Some nouns can be challenging to use in the plural. The simple rules that follow will help. 
To check the spelling of plural forms of words derived from Latin and Greek that retain their Latin or Greek endings (typically -a, -us, -um, -on, -ix, or -ex), see specific entries in the A Z word list and Merriam-Webster Dictionary.
Noun
Plural form
Examples
Common and proper nouns ending in s
If the noun ends in s, add es.
the Johnsons
the Joneses
biases
Singular abbreviation
Add an s, even if the abbreviation ends in s.
ISVs
DBMSs
Plural abbreviation
If an abbreviation already represents a plural, don't add an s.
MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
Single letter
Add an apostrophe and an s. 
The letter itself (but not the apostrophe or the ending s) is italic.
x's
Number
Add an s.
the 1950s
Variable 
Don't add (s) to a word to indicate that it could be either singular or plural unless you have no other choice. Use the plural form instead.
Wait for x minutes. 
20.3.1.3 Pronouns and gender
Don't use gendered pronouns in generic references. Instead, rewrite for example, use the second person (you). Or refer to a person's role (customer, employee, or client). It's OK to use he, she, or they when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves. 
They can be used as a non-binary pronoun for a singular person instead of a binary pronoun (she or he). 
For more guidelines about how to write using gender-neutral pronouns, see Bias-free communication. 
20.3.1.4 Pronouns and collective nouns
Collective nouns like company take a singular pronoun. Don't use a plural pronoun (like they) for a collective noun.
Examples
Meet with up to 250 people. All they need is a phone or internet connection. 
The company upgraded its cloud storage solution to Microsoft Azure.
Exception If the emphasis is on the individuals in a group, it's OK to use a plural pronoun with a singular noun.
Using pronouns in product UI
See also Person
 
20.4 Words ending in -ing
A word ending in  ing can be a verb, a noun, or an adjective. Use  ing words with care. The sentence should make it clear which role the word plays. 
For example, we don t know whether the heading, Meeting requirements, will be a discussion of how to meet requirements or the requirements for a meeting. These examples are clearer:
* The meeting requirements
* Meeting the requirements
* The requirements for the meeting
* How to meet the requirements
20.5 Prepositions
20.5.1.1 Prepositional phrases
A prepositional phrase is a combination of a preposition and a noun that modifies or describes some part of a sentence. In the following sentence:
The reading pane displays the content of the selected message.
The prepositional phrase, of the selected message, describes the noun, the content. 
Avoid joining more than two prepositional phrases. Long chains of prepositional phrases are hard to read and easy to misinterpret.
Learn more For information about using prepositional phrases in procedures, see Writing step-by-step instructions.
20.5.1.2 Placement in the sentence
It s OK to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability.
Examples
Use a different instrumentation key for each environment that your application runs in.
Specify which event hub you want to send the data to.
20.6 Dangling and misplaced modifiers
Modifiers are single words or phrases that modify other words or phrases. Position a modifier to make it clear what it modifies.
If you keep sentences short and simple and use active voice, you probably won t run into dangling or misplaced modifiers. 
* A dangling modifier doesn t modify anything in the sentence. 
* A misplaced modifier is too far from the thing it modifies or too near to something else that it could modify. 
 
Example 
Meaning 
Only the selected text is deleted. 
Nothing other than the selected text is deleted.
The selected text only is deleted.
Only could modify is deleted or text. This sentence could mean one of two things: 
* The selected graphics aren't deleted.
* The text is deleted but not archived. 
There are files that can't be removed on the drive. 
The phrase that can't be removed modifies the files. This sentence clearly explains that the files can't be removed, and they are on the drive. 
There are files on the drive that can't be removed.
The phrase that can't be removed probably modifies the drive, but the writer may have intended to modify files. This sentence could mean one of two things: 
* The files can't be removed.
* The drive can't be removed. 
21 Images and video
Pictures can bring stories to life, simplify complex content, and replace a lot of words. Use images and video when they help you convey information or supplement the story. Most websites, templates, and publishing platforms have guidelines for using images and video. Start there. This section will help you choose or create the right images for your message:
* Photos
* Illustrations
* Screenshots
* Network traffic flows
* Video
Before using images in your content, familiarize yourself with the following guidelines:
* Bias-free communication
* Graphics, design, and media (Accessibility)
* Copyrights and trademarks
21.1 Photos
Microsoft photos are authentic, optimistic, and brave.
* Authentic You believe it and feel like you re there.
* Optimistic We illuminate the joy and triumph of everyday life.
* Brave We aren t afraid to stand out and be ourselves.
When you need photos to illustrate web content or marketing collateral, use the Microsoft photo library, an expansive set of shared lifestyle and product photography available for use in Microsoft communications. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) Avoid purchasing stock photography if you can. 
To learn more about images and the Microsoft brand, see the Microsoft brand photography guidelines. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
 
21.2 Illustrations
Follow Microsoft brand illustration guidelines if you re using illustrations in your content. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Tell an engaging story. Illustration should have a purpose beyond decoration. Use it to communicate a clear message in a visually engaging way.
Stylize with active geometry. Microsoft illustration style utilizes geometric shapes that feel digital and align with our product user experiences. Illustration should be simple, but never static or sterile.
Use vivid color. Use energetic, flat colors drawn from the Microsoft color palette. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Use the Microsoft illustration library. Avoid purchasing stock illustration whenever possible. Find a Microsoft illustration. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
Make sure you have legal permission to use the illustrations in your content. To learn about legal guidelines for using images, see Copyrights and trademarks.
Avoid using text in illustrations that will be localized. If you must use text, put it on a separate layer from the graphics. To learn more about using images in global communications, see Art.
If illustrations convey information that s important to the story, describe them clearly and completely in captions or alt text to support people with low vision. To learn more about accessible images, see Graphics, design, and media.
21.3 Screenshots
Screenshots are useful for simplifying complex procedures or concepts. But use them sparingly. If they contain text, and most do, localizing them is expensive and time-consuming. 
When you use screenshots, follow these guidelines.
* Show only the portion of the screen that's necessary to explain the concept or procedure. 
Example

* Create text in the interface that reflects Microsoft voice and editorial style. 
* Use approved fictitious names and scenarios. To learn more, see Fictitious names, domains, and addresses. 
* Describe the image clearly and completely in captions or alt text to support people with low vision. To learn more about accessible images, see Graphics, design, and media.
* If the screenshot will be localized, give your localization team or vendor the files shown in the image, in addition to detailed instructions on how to re-create the screenshot. 
21.4 Video
Done well, video often communicates faster and more clearly than text and static images. But video usually takes longer and costs more to produce, requires more bandwidth to view, can be expensive to localize, and may not meet your accessibility goals. Balance the tradeoffs, and do what s best for your customers and your business goals.
Follow these guidelines:
* Keep videos short under 90 seconds when you can. For more complex subjects, consider creating several short segments and combining them in a playlist.

* Write video titles that describe the content clearly. Include the video length. 

* Lead with what s most important. Make your key points clear and memorable. Get to them quickly, without lengthy introductions, and stick to them. Don't include extraneous detail or try to communicate more than the viewer can take in.

* Tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Simple narratives are best. Start by telling viewers what they'll learn. End with a call to action to try it themselves.

* Use the same voice principles that you use in other content. For more information, see Brand voice. 

* Maintain a consistent pace and ratio of audio to video. Don't talk too fast or too slowly. Practice timing your actions with your words. 
* Speak and enunciate clearly. 
* Don t be afraid to be silent while you complete the actions, and don t worry about explaining every action. Visual images can communicate simple, common actions, such as selecting OK.
* Don t refer back to earlier parts of the video unless it s necessary. If you must refer to earlier parts of the video, keep it general. 
Example
Earlier, you saw how to add x to z. Here's something else you can do with x ....
* Include captions for accessibility. If possible, break closed-captioning into short, one-sentence chunks, so they're easier to read.
* Avoid mentioning dates and product versions or showing images that will date your content. This will keep your video relevant longer. 
* Close a video with a URL where the viewer can learn more. 
* Use brand elements and colors for opening and closing frames. The easiest way to do that is to use the Microsoft end-card animation and guidelines. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) Clearly identifying Microsoft as the source gives your video added credibility.

In the rare instances where available fictitious content doesn t meet your needs, the Trademark group will review new fictitious content if your request meets certain criteria. See Approved fictitious names & guidelines on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
Domain names
If you need to use a generic domain name or URL in content, use Example.com, Example.org, or Example.net. These domain names are reserved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for use in documentation examples. You can also use Microsoft.com or the home page of your product website. Don t use other domain names, which may be owned by individuals or companies. 
IP addresses Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has set aside several ranges of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for use on intranets. These IP addresses are documented in Internet RFC 1918 and are guaranteed never to correspond to any real-world computer on the internet. They include:
* 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255, inclusive  
* 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255, inclusive  
* 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255, inclusive 
You can use any address within those ranges as an example. For maximum realism, choose an address that doesn't contain zeros from one of the latter two blocks.
If you have a question about using fictitious content, contact your group s paralegal. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
22.4 Legal issues and types of content
Different types of content require different legal coverage. For instance, testimonials require a signed quote permission form. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) And tweeting, posting, pinning, and engaging with customers on Microsoft's behalf requires you familiarize yourself with the rules in Guidelines for engaging with social media. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
Request a legal review for:

* Partnership and business relationships
23 New products
Brand-new products have a few special considerations.
This section includes the following articles:
* Name development
* Product previews
* Code names  
* System requirements
See also Legal content
23.1 Name development
If you re developing a new name whether for a product or service, a feature, a campaign or program, an event, or an internal tool reach out to your product marketing team or engage in your group s established process for name development. Get a geopolitical review, and include legal and branding teams in the naming process. 
Learn more For information about the naming process, see the Brand Central naming guidelines. For Microsoft's approach to localizing names, see the Brand Central name localization guidelines. (These pages require Microsoft network access.) 
23.2 Product previews
Prerelease versions of software and services are typically identified as Product Name Preview (preferred) or Code Name Preview. Do not use Public Preview or Private Preview.
To indicate a feature is in preview, follow the name with (preview).
In generic references, lowercase preview.
Avoid using beta to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Use preview instead.
Examples
Office 2016 Preview
Windows 10 Insider Preview
Microsoft Power BI Preview
A preview of Azure Container Service is available.
Previews are subject to different terms and conditions than major releases. Check with your group's paralegal for details. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
23.3 Code names
Before you create or use code names for existing products, new offerings, or acquisitions, review CELAWeb Code name guidelines. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
?In external communications, use the final name for the product rather than a code name if possible. A code name must be approved by someone with P&L authority and by the Microsoft Brand Studio before it can be used in external communications. Submit the proposed code name to the Brand Central Help Center or your Brand team contact for approval. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
If your code name is approved, follow CELA guidelines for using code names in external communications. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
Avoid using code names in documentation. If you must use a code name:
* Try to limit use to article titles or regular text. 
* Never use code names in file names, art, context IDs, or link text. 
* Be careful to replace all instances of the code name when the official name is confirmed.
23.4 System requirements
Accurate system requirements for products, services, and downloads enhance the customer experience as well as minimize legal risk. This is true for trial, evaluation, and prerelease or preview products, too. 
There are plenty of options for documenting system requirements. Starting with system requirements from the previous version can speed things up. Keep these guidelines in mind:
* Follow the System requirements guidelines on CELAWeb, and discuss your ideas with your group's paralegal. (These pages require Microsoft network access.) 
* If customers obtain a product digitally, make sure the system requirements are available via a prominent link on the purchase or download page. It s a good idea to create a webpage for system requirements for packaged products, too.
24 Numbers
Be consistent in your use of numbers. When you write about numbers used in examples or UI, duplicate them exactly as they appear in the UI. In all other content, follow the guidelines below.
24.1.1.1 Numerals vs. words
* In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine, and use numerals for 10 or greater. It's OK to use numerals for zero through nine when you have limited space, such as in tables and UI. 
Examples 
10 screen savers  
five databases  
zero probability  
7,990,000  
1,000 
* Spell out zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater for days, weeks, and other units of time. 
Examples
seven years 
28 days 
12 hrs 
* If one item requires a numeral, use numerals for all the other items of that type. 
Examples
One article has 16 pages, one has 7 pages, and the third has only 5 pages.
Microsoft Inspire is only one month and 12 days away.
* When two numbers that refer to different things must appear together, use a numeral for one and spell out the other. 
Example fifteen 20-page articles
* Don't start a sentence with a numeral. Add a modifier before the number, or spell the number out if you can't rewrite the sentence. It's OK to start list items with numerals use your judgment.
Examples
More than 10 apps are included. 
Eleven apps are included. 
* Use numerals in these situations.
Use numerals for
Examples
Measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size, weight, pixels, points, and so on even if the number is less than 10.
3 feet, 5 inches
1.76 lb
80   80 pixels
0.75 grams
3 centimeters    
3 cm 
A number the customer is directed to enter.
Enter 5.
A round number of 1 million or more.
7 million
7M
Dimensions. Spell out by, except for tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes. For those, use the multiplication sign ( ). Use a space before and after the multiplication sign.
10-foot cable  
4   4 tile   
8.5"   11" paper 
1280 נ1024
Time of day. Include AM or PM.
Exception Don't use numerals for 12:00. Use noon or midnight instead.
Include the time zone if you're discussing an event, and customers beyond the local time zone may see it. Time stamps in UI and websites usually display local time and date automatically.
10:45 AM
6:30 PM
The meeting is at noon. 
The event starts at 5:00 PM Pacific Time. 
The date changes at midnight. 
Percentages, no matter how small. Use a numeral plus percent to specify a percentage. Use percentage when you don't specify a quantity.
At least 50 percent of your system resources should be available.
Only 1 percent of the test group was unable to complete the task.
A large percentage of system resources should be available. 
Coordinates of tables or worksheets and numbered sections of documents.
row 3, column 4 
Volume 2  
Chapter 10  
Part 5  
step 1
 
24.1.1.2 Commas in numbers
Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits.
Examples
$1,024
1,093 MB
Exception When designating years, pixels, or baud, use commas only when the number has five or more digits.
Examples
2500 B.C. 
10,000 B.C.
1920   1080 pixels 
10,240   4320 pixels 
9600 baud
14,400 baud
Don't use commas in page numbers, addresses, or after the decimal point in decimal fractions.
Examples
page 1091
15601 NE 40thStreet
1.06377 units
24.1.1.3 Numbers in dates
Don't use ordinal numbers, such as June first or October twenty-eighth, for dates. Use a numeral instead: June 1, October 28.
Global tip To avoid confusion, always spell out the name of the month. The positions of the month and day vary by country. For example, 6/12/2017 might be June 12, 2017 or December 6, 2017.
24.1.1.4 Phone numbers
Use hyphens not parentheses, periods, spaces, or anything else to separate the parts of a phone number. 
Example
612-555-0175
For information about creating fictitious phone numbers for use in scenarios, see the fictitious content provided on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 
Global tip For information about how to format phone numbers in a region outside the United States and Canada, refer to the localization style guide for that region. 
24.1.1.5 Negative numbers
Form a negative number with an en dash, not a hyphen:
Example  79
24.1.1.6 Compound numbers
Hyphenate compound numbers when they're spelled out.
Examples
twenty-five fonts
the twenty-first day
24.1.1.7 Fractions and decimals
* Express fractions in words, as symbols, or as decimals, whichever is most appropriate. 
* In tables, align decimals on the decimal point. 
* Add a zero before the decimal point for decimal fractions less than one, unless the customer is asked to enter the value.
Examples
0.5 cm 
enter .75"
* Don't use numerals separated by a slash to express fractions. 
Exception When an equation occurs in text, it's OK to use a slash between the numerator and the denominator. Or, in Microsoft Word, go to the Insert tab, and select Equation to format the equation automatically.
Example   +   = 1
* Hyphenate spelled-out fractions. Connect the numerator and denominator with a hyphen unless either already contains a hyphen. 
Examples
one-third of the page  
two-thirds completed  
three sixty-fourths 
* In measurements where the unit of measure is spelled out, use the plural form when the quantity is a decimal fraction. Use the singular form only when the quantity is 1. 
Examples
0.5 inches   
0 inches
1 inch  
5 inches
24.1.1.8 Ordinal numbers
* Always spell out ordinal numbers. 
Examples
the first row
the twenty-first anniversary
* Don't use ordinal numbers, such as June first, for dates.  

* Don't add -ly to an ordinal number, as in firstly or secondly.
24.1.1.9 Ranges of numbers
* In most cases, use from and through to describe a range of numbers.
Example from 9 through 17
Exceptions 
Use an en dash in a range of pages or where space is an issue, such as in tables and UI. For example, 2016 2020 and pages 112 120.   
Use to in a range of times. For example, 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.
* Don't use from before a range indicated by an en dash, such as 10 15. 
24.1.1.10 Abbreviations 
In general, don't abbreviate thousand, million, and billion as K, M, and B. Spell out thousand, million, and billion, or use the entire number. 
Examples 
Fabrikam, Inc., employs more than 65,000 people. 
Total cost to the enterprise: 300,000 hours and $30 million per year 
In UI, avoid the abbreviations unless space is too limited to spell out the number.
Global tip Contact your localization team before using these abbreviations in content that will be localized. Machine translation might not translate them correctly. Also, an abbreviated form might not be available or might be longer in the target language, so allow space for expansion in localized content.
If you must use the abbreviations, follow these guidelines: 
* Capitalize K, M, and B. 
* Don't put a space between the number and the abbreviation. 
* Use the decimal form of a number only if it really will save space. In particular, avoid the use of a decimal with K 8.21K has the same number of characters as 8,210.

25 Procedures and instructions
When developing help or documentation content, the best procedure is the one users don t need. If the UI is crystal clear and leads the customer through a task, a how-to procedure isn t necessary. Start there, with the product's Content Design team. (See UI text and design for specific tips.)
Some tasks are more complex. When help or documentation needs to provide step-by-step instructions, look for the clearest way to present it. That might be:
* A picture, an illustration, a poster, or an infographic

* A video.

* A one-sentence instruction.

* A numbered procedure, which might include pictures, videos, and links or buttons that take customers where they need to go.

When a procedure is the best approach, use the guidelines in this section to create consistent instructions that are easy to follow:
* Writing step-by-step instructions describes several ways to write simple and complex instructions.
* Describing interactions with UI provides a list of input-neutral verbs you can use to write instructions that work with any input method.
* Describing alternative input methods explains how to describe customer interactions with UI using mouse, keyboard, joystick, pen, touch, and sensor input and how to consolidate more than one method in instructions. 
* Formatting text in instructions lists the formatting conventions for elements commonly used in instructions.
Note Document all the ways that customers can interact with your UI, to comply with Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS) requirements and support customers of all abilities. This includes mouse, keyboard, voice recognition, game controller, gesture, and any other input method or device that the product or service supports. The easiest way to approach this is to fully document interactions using each input method, and then write procedures that use input-neutral verbs. 
25.1 Writing step-by-step instructions
Follow these guidelines to help you create clear, easy-to-follow instructions, whether you're writing simple, single-step procedures or complex procedures that consist of multiple steps.

25.1.1.1 Complex procedures
Complex instructions often consist of multiple steps formatted as a numbered list. For multiple-step procedures in numbered lists: 
* Format procedures consistently so customers can find them easily by scanning.
* Consider using a heading to help customers find instructions quickly. Use the heading to tell customers what the instructions will help them do. 
Examples
To add an account 
Add an account

Choose one phrasing style for the headings, and write them all the same way (in parallel structure).
* Use a separate numbered entry for each step. It's OK to combine short steps that occur in the same place in the UI.
* Most of the time, include actions that finalize a step, such as OK or Apply buttons.
* Use complete sentences.
* Use imperative verb forms. In instructions, customers really want you to tell them what to do.
* Use consistent sentence structures. For example, always use a phrase when you need to tell the customer where to start. The rest of the time, start each sentence with a verb. 
Examples
On the ribbon, go to the Design tab. 
Open Photos. 
For Alignment, choose Left.
* Capitalize the first word in each step. 
* Use a period after each step. 
Exception
When instructing customers to type input that doesn't include end punctuation, don t use a period. Try to format the text so that the user input appears on a new line.
* Limit a procedure to seven steps, and preferably fewer. Try to fit all the steps on the same screen. 
Examples
To create a group of tiles
1. On the Start screen, select the tiles you want to group together. 
2. Drag them to an open space. When a gray bar appears behind them, release the tiles to create the new group. 
To schedule sprints
1. In the Backlogs view, select the first sprint under Current. Or, open your sprint backlog from the following URL:
http://AccountName/DefaultCollection/TeamProjectName/_backlogs/iteration

Several predefined sprints are listed under Current and Future. Actual sprint titles vary based on the process template used to create your team project. However, calendar dates haven t been assigned. 
2. To set the calendar dates, select the first sprint under Current, and select dates. 

25.1.1.2 Single-step procedures
If you're using a consistent format for step-by-step instructions, use the same format for single-step instructions, but replace the number with a bullet. 
Example
To move a group of tiles
* On the Start screen, zoom out and drag the group where you want.
25.1.1.3 Tips for writing steps
Make sure the customer knows where the action should take place before you describe the action. 
* If the instruction appears in the same UI where the action occurs, it s usually not necessary to provide location details.
* If you need to make sure the customer begins in the right place, provide a brief phrase at the beginning of the step. 
Example On the Design tab, select Header Row.
* If there s a chance of confusion, provide an introductory step. 
Example On the ribbon, go to the Design tab.
25.1.1.4 Simple instructions with right angle brackets
Abbreviate simple sequences by using right angle brackets. Include a space before and after each bracket, and don't make the brackets bold. 
Example Select Accounts > Other accounts > Add an account.
Accessibility tip Screen readers may skip over brackets and read instructions such as Menu > Go To > Folders as Menu Go To Folders, which might confuse customers. Check with your group s accessibility expert before using this approach.
25.2 Describing interactions with UI
Customers interact with products using different input methods: keyboard, mouse, touch, voice, and more. So use generic verbs that work with any input method. Don't use input-specific verbs, such as click or swipe. Instead, use the verbs listed here.

25.3 Describing alternative input methods
If you use input-neutral methods in instructions, provide an article that explains how to interact with the product using each available input method. (The article can be in the product or included in documentation or Help.) To support customers regardless of their ability or the device they use, include mice, keyboards, voice recognition devices, game controllers, touch, and other interaction methods. Use the Accessibility Product Template to get started. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
Learn more To learn more about creating accessible content, see Accessibility guidelines and requirements.
25.3.1.1 Mouse procedures
Be consistent in how you list mouse procedures. For example, always list the mouse method before the keyboard method if you document both. Don't combine keyboard and mouse actions as if they were keyboard shortcuts unless space is limited. For example, don't use Shift+click. Instead, use Select Shift while clicking  .
See also Mouse and mouse interaction term collection
25.3.1.2 Joystick procedures
Assume that the mouse is the primary input device. Include joystick information in a table along with other alternative input devices. 
Refer to joystick controls, not options, when you provide specific joystick procedures.
Keyboard procedures
Always document keyboard procedures for accessibility, even if they're indicated in UI (for example, by underlined letters).
See also Keys and keyboard shortcuts term collection 
Pen-computing and touch procedures 
Use tap and double-tap instead of click and double-click when writing content specific to touching a screen or using a tablet pen. Tap means to press the screen with a finger or pen tip and then to lift it, usually quickly.
 
Term
Usage
tap
Use to describe selecting a button, icon, or other element on the screen with a finger or the pen by tapping it once. Don't use tap on.
double-tap
Use to describe selecting an item by tapping twice in rapid succession. Hyphenate. Don't use double-tap on. 
tap and hold
Use only if the app requires it to complete a specific interaction. Don't use touch and hold.
pan
Use to describe moving the screen in multiple directions at a controlled rate, as you would pana camera to see different views. For contact gestures, use pan to refer to moving a finger, hand, or pen on the device surface to move through screens or menus at a controlled rate, rather than quickly skipping through content using the flick gesture. Don't use drag or scroll as a synonym for pan.
flick
Use to describe moving one or more fingers to scroll through items on the screen. Don't use scroll.
swipe
Use to describe a short, quick movement in the direction opposite to how the page scrolls. For example, if the page scrolls left or right, swipe an item up or down to select it. 
See also Touch and pen interaction term collection
25.3.1.3 Multiple input methods and branching within procedures
You can document multiple input methods in various ways, depending on the content design, space restrictions, and other considerations. Some approaches are discussed below. Consult your group's editorial style guide for more specific guidelines about how to document and format multiple input methods.
List the steps in a table and provide a separate column for each input method. 
Example
Choose colors to use on webpages.
To make webpages easier to see, you can change the text, background, link, and hover colors in Internet Explorer.
 
Mouse actions 
Keyboard actions 
On the Start menu:  
* Click Internet Explorer. 
Display the Start menu by pressing the Windows logo  key:                                               .
* Select Internet Explorer by using the arrow keys, and then press Enter. 
In Internet Explorer:
1. Click the Tools menu.
2. Click Internet Options.
In Internet Explorer: 
1. Select the Tools menu by pressing Alt+T.
2. Select Internet Options by pressing O. 
Document the primary input method and provide the alternative instructions in parentheses or separate sentences after the main instructions. 
Examples
To pan, slide one finger in any direction (or drag the mouse pointer, or use the arrow keys). 
To copy the selection, click Copy on the toolbar. You can also press Ctrl+C.
If there are multiple ways to perform an entire procedure and you must describe each one, use a table to detail the alternatives. This approach helps the customer decide when to use which method.
Example This table describes two ways to save a file.
To
Do this
Save changes to the file and continue working.
On the File menu, click Save.
Save changes to the file and close the program. 
On the File menu, click Exit. If a dialog asks whether you want to save changes, click Yes.
If one step has an alternative, make that alternative a separate paragraph in the step. In a single-step procedure, an alternative can be separated by the word or to make it clear that an alternative is available. 

Examples
Press the key for the underlined letter in the menu name. You can also use the Left arrow key or the Right arrow key to move to another menu.
* Press Alt+the key for the underlined letter in the menu name. 
or 
* Use the Left arrow key or the Right arrow key to move to another menu. 
For several choices within one procedure step, use a bulleted list. 
Example
1. Select the text that you want to move or copy. 

   Do one of the following:
* To remove the selection, click Cut on the Quick Access Toolbar.
* To copy the selection, click Copy on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
2. Right-click where you want to insert the text, and then click Paste on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 
25.4 Formatting text in instructions
Consistent text formatting helps readers locate and interpret information. Follow these conventions for formatting elements that frequently appear in instructions (also referred to as procedures). 
Your team might vary from these guidelines to meet your content needs. Check your group's editorial style guide for additional conventions.

Assign services to the "No business data allowed" group.
Use bold formatting.
Assign services to either the Business data only or No business data allowed group.
 
 
26 Punctuation
Punctuation provides vital clues for reader understanding. It's governed by well-documented rules. For example, every English sentence requires end punctuation (unless it's a title or a heading). Within those rules are stylistic choices, which we ll cover here. 
Writing tip The more punctuation you add, the more complex a sentence becomes. If a sentence contains more than a comma or two and ending punctuation, consider rewriting it to make it crisp and clear. 
Learn more Refer to The Chicago Manual of Style to learn more about specific punctuation.
This section covers:
* Formatting punctuation in text describing interaction with the UI, parentheses, and brackets.
* Apostrophes in possessives and contractions.
* Colons in lists and to elaborate on a statement.
* Commas in series, clauses, and dates.
* Dashes and hyphens, including:
o Em dashes to set off phrases.
o En dashes in open or hyphenated compound words and with numbers.
o Hyphens in words and spelled-out numbers.
* Ellipses in syntax and for omissions. 
* Exclamation points, used sparingly.
* Periods in sentences and lists.
* Question marks, used sparingly.
* Quotation marks for quotations only.
* Semicolons between independent clauses, contrasting statements, and items in a list.
* Slashes in phrases, file paths, and URLs.
26.1 Formatting punctuation
In general, format punctuation in the same font style as the main content of a sentence or phrase.
26.1.1.1 Text describing interaction with the UI
In instructions that reference elements such as commands, options, keywords, placeholders, links, pop-up text, and user input:
* If the punctuation is part of the element, such as punctuation that the customer must type, format the punctuation the same as the element. 
Example Enter Balance due: in cell A14. 
(In this example, the colon is bold because the customer types the colon.)
* If the punctuation is not part of the element, format the punctuation the same as the main text. 
Examples
On the Insert menu, go to Pictures, and then select From File. 
(In this example, the comma following Pictures and the period following File aren't bold because the punctuation isn't part of the UI labels.)

Select Accounts > Other accounts > Add an account.
(In this example, brackets aren't bold because they aren't part of the UI labels.)
26.1.1.2 Parentheses and brackets
Format parentheses and brackets in the font style of the main text, not of the text in the parentheses or brackets.
Example Open any Office app and select File > Account. (If you're doing this in Outlook, select File > Office Account.) 
(In this example, the opening and closing parentheses aren't bold, to match the main text.)
Use the same font style for the closing parenthesis or bracket that you use for the opening parenthesis or bracket. 
26.2 Apostrophes
26.2.1.1 Use an apostrophe: 
* To form the possessive case of nouns. For singular nouns, add an apostrophe and an s, even if the noun ends in s, x, or z. To form the possessive of plural nouns that end in s, add only an apostrophe.
Examples
insider's guide 
the box's contents
the CSS's flexibility 
Berlioz's opera 
an OEM's product 
users' passwords 
the Joneses' computer

* To indicate a missing letter in a contraction.
Examples
can't 
don't 
it's
26.2.1.2 Don t use an apostrophe:
* For the possessive form of it. 
Example Replace a formula with its calculated value.
* With a possessive pronoun.
Example The choice is yours.
* To form the plural of a singular noun. 
Example Play your favorite games on all your devices.
Note Don't use the possessive form of Microsoft trademarks and product, service, or feature names.
26.3 Colons
26.3.1.1 Preceding lists
Include a colon at the end of a phrase that directly introduces a list.
Example
You can create a backup of all sorts of things to make the transition easier, including:   
* The apps you've installed on your phone, along with high scores and progress from participating apps.
* The passwords for your accounts.   
* Your call history. 
To learn more, see Lists.
Within sentences
Use colons sparingly at the end of a statement followed by a second statement that expands on it. 
Example Microsoft ActiveSync doesn't recognize this device for one of two reasons: the device wasn't connected properly or the device isn't a smartphone.
Most of the time, two sentences are more readable.
When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless:
* The colon introduces a direct quotation.
Example What does it mean when I see a message that asks: "Are you trying to visit this site?"
* The first word after the colon is a proper noun. 
Example We're considering three cities for the event: Los Angeles, Munich, and Tokyo. 
In titles and headings 
When you use a colon in a title or heading, capitalize the word that follows it.  
Examples 
Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces

Why girls lose interest in STEM: New research has some answers

Get started with Azure IoT: An interactive developer guide 
In UI
Don't use colons when introducing lists of radio buttons or checkboxes. 

26.4 Commas
26.4.1.1 Use a comma:
* Before the conjunction in a list of three or more items. (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma.)
Examples
Outlook includes Mail, Calendar, People, and Tasks.
Save your file to a hard drive, an external drive, or OneDrive.
Writing tip If a series contains more than three items or the items are long, consider a bulleted list to improve readability.
* Following an introductory phrase. 
Example With the Skype app, you can call any phone.
* To join independent clauses with a conjunction, such as and, or, but, or so.
Example Select Options, and then select Enable fast saves.
Writing tip If the sentence is long or complex, consider rewriting as two sentences.
* In a series of two or more adjectives that precede a noun, if the order of the adjectives can be reversed or if they can be separated by and without changing the meaning.
Examples 
Adjust the innovative, built-in Kickstand and Type Cover. 
PlayFab is a complete back-end platform.
Writing tip Consider rewriting for a friendlier, more conversational tone. For example, say, "Build mixed-reality apps that support collaboration across platforms," not "Build collaborative, cross-platform mixed-reality apps."
* To surround the year when you use a complete date within a sentence.
Example See the product reviews in the February 4, 2015, issue of the New York Times.
For information about using commas in numbers, see Numbers.
26.4.1.2 Don't use a comma:
* To join independent clauses when you don't use a conjunction. (Use a semicolon instead.)
Example Select Options; then select Enable fast saves.
* Between verbs in a compound predicate (when two verbs apply to a single subject).
Example The program evaluates your computer system and then copies the essential files to the target location. 
Writing tip Consider replacing a compound predicate with two sentences. Or add a subject for the second verb. 
Examples 
The program evaluates your computer system. Then it copies the essential files to the target location.  
The program evaluates your computer system, and then it copies the essential files to the target location. 
* Between the month and the year when a specific date isn't mentioned.
26.5 Dashes and hyphens
Dashes and hyphens aren t interchangeable. Follow these guidelines to help you use them the right way, in the right places.
* Em dashes. Use to set off or emphasize parenthetical phrases.
* En dashes. Use in ranges of numbers and dates, in negative numbers, and as a minus sign. Use to connect compound modifiers under specific conditions.
* Hyphens. Use to join words and connect prefixes to stem words. Don t use two hyphens in place of an em dash.
26.5.1 Em dashes
Use an em dash ( ) to set off a parenthetical phrase with more emphasis than parentheses provide. Don t add spaces around an em dash.
* Use one em dash on each side of a phrase embedded in a sentence. 
Example The information in your spreadsheet numbers, formulas, and text is stored in cells.
* Use one em dash to set off a phrase or clause at the end of a sentence.
Example If you're not sure about the details, look at the illustrations in the wizard they can help you figure out what type of connection you re using.
Don t use an em dash:
* In place of a bullet character in a list.
* To indicate an empty cell in a table.
Don t capitalize the first word after an em dash unless the word is a proper noun.
26.5.2 En dashes
Use an en dash ( ):
* To indicate a range of numbers, such as inclusive values, dates, or pages. 
Example 2015 2017
* For a minus sign.
Example 12   3 = 9 
* To indicate negative numbers.
Example  79
Use an en dash ( ) instead of a hyphen in a compound modifier when:
* One element of the modifier is an open compound.
Examples
Windows 10 compatible products 
dialog type options
* Two or more of the elements are made up of hyphenated compounds (a rare occurrence). 
Don t use an en dash to indicate an empty cell in a table.
Don t use spaces on either side of an en dash. 
Exception Surround an en dash with spaces when it's used as a minus sign in an equation, in a time stamp appearing in UI, or in a date range that includes two times and two dates.
12   3 = 9  
2:15 PM   4:45 PM (time stamp in UI)  
2:15 PM 12/1/17   4:45 PM 4/1/18 (range includes both time and date)
In text, don t use an en dash in a range of times. Use to instead: 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM. In a schedule or listing, use an en dash with no spaces around it: 10:00 AM 2:00 PM.

26.5.3 Hyphens
For information about hyphenating specific technology words, see the A Z word list. For information about hyphenating common words, see Merriam-Webster Dictionary and The Chicago Manual of Style. 
26.5.3.1 Predicate adjectives
Don't hyphenate a predicate adjective (an adjective that complements the subject of a sentence and follows a linking verb) unless the Microsoft Writing Style Guide specifically recommends it. Check the A Z word list to find out.
Examples
The text is left aligned.
The camera is built in.
Many viruses are memory-resident.
Noun modifiers
In compound words that precede and modify a noun as a unit, don t hyphenate:
* Very, when it precedes another modifier.

ExampleVery fast test
* An adverb ending in -ly, such as completely, when it precedes another modifier. Check Merriam-Webster Dictionary if you're not sure whether the word ending in -ly is an adverb.

Examples
extremely stylized image
highly graphical interface

Note Use adverbs sparingly. They usually aren't necessary.
Hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify a noun as a unit if:
* Confusion might result without the hyphen.
Examples
built-in drive  
high-level-language compiler  
read-only memory  
lower-left corner 
floating-point decimal  
line-by-line scrolling  
scrolling line by line
up-to-date information
* One of the words is a past or present participle (a verb form ending in -ed or -ing and used as an adjective or noun).
Examples
left-aligned text  
free-flowing form
well-defined schema
The schema is well defined.
* The modifier is a number or single letter plus a noun or participle.
Examples
two-sided arrow  
5-point star  
y-coordinate values
26.5.3.2 Suspended compound modifiers
* Don t use suspended compound modifiers, such as left- and right-aligned text, unless space is limited. Instead, spell out the entire phrase.
Example upper-right or lower-right corner
* If you use a suspended compound modifier, include a hyphen with both adjectives. The first hyphen is followed by a space.
Example upper- or lower-right corner
* Don t form suspended compound modifiers from one-word adjectives. 
Example uppercase and lowercase letters
26.5.3.3 Compound nouns
Hyphenate compound nouns when one of the words is abbreviated.
Examples
e-book 
e-commerce
Exception email
26.5.3.4 Compound numerals and fractions
Hyphenate compound numerals and fractions.
Examples 
a twenty-fifth anniversary  
one-third of the page
En dashes in compound adjectives
Use an en dash ( ) instead of a hyphen in a compound adjective when:
* The compound adjective includes an open compound.
Examples
Windows 10 compatible products 
dialog box type options
* Two or more of the elements are made up of hyphenated compounds (a rare occurrence). 
26.5.3.5 Prefixes
Avoid creating new words by adding prefixes to existing words. Rewrite to avoid creating a new word. If a word with a prefix is listed in Merriam-Webster Dictionary or the A Z word list, it s OK to use in Microsoft content. 
In general, don t include a hyphen after the following prefixes unless omitting the hyphen could confuse the reader.                            
auto-
exa-
mega-
pre-
tera-
co-
giga-
micro-
re-
un-
cyber-
kilo-
non-
sub-
 
Use a hyphen between a prefix and a stem word:
* If a confusing word results without the hyphen.

Examples
non-native
pre-provisioned
* If the stem word begins with a capital letter. 

Example non-XML
A prefix affects a word, not a phrase. For example, instead of non-security related, use unrelated to security.
When adding a prefix to a stem word results in a double vowel and each vowel is pronounced, don t use a hyphen. 
Examples
reenter
cooperate
For more information about using prefixes, see The Chicago Manual of Style. 
26.5.3.6 Capitalization in hyphenated compound words
Capitalize any part of a hyphenated compound word that would?be capitalized if there were no hyphen.?
Examples
Compound word
Example Sentence
Customer-friendly
Customer-friendly?content is brief, accurate, and to the point.
E-Book
Bisson, Guillermo.?The App E-Book.?Redmond, WA: Lucerne?Publishing, 2015.
Add-ins
Bisson, Guillermo.?Programming Office 365 Applications, SharePoint Add-ins, and More.?Redmond, WA: Lucerne Publishing, 2015.
 
 
26.6 Ellipses
In general, don t use an ellipsis ( ) except in the situations described here or to indicate omitted code in technical content. 
It's OK to use an ellipsis to indicate a pause in conversational UI messages.
Example (Hmm ... looks like that link is broken.)
When there's an ellipsis in UI, don t include it in instructions or procedures.
Example Select Safety, and then Delete browsing history.
In quoted material, use an ellipsis to indicate omitted text.
* If the ellipsis replaces text within a sentence, include a space before and after the ellipsis.
  Example The quick brown fox   lazy dog.
* If the ellipsis replaces the end of a quoted sentence, include a space before the ellipsis and follow it with a closing period, with no intervening space. 
Example The quick brown fox  .
It s OK to use an ellipsis in multiple-part callouts, especially with screenshots or graphics in documentation. 

* Ensure that the path through the callouts is clear. Document each step.
* Insert a space and then an ellipsis at the end of a phrase that continues later. 
Insert an ellipsis followed by a space at the beginning of a phrase that's continued from a previous phrase.
* If the callout ends with additional punctuation, such as a period or comma, insert a space between the punctuation mark and the ellipsis.
If you're writing in an environment that doesn't have the Segoe font and using a font that doesn't have the ellipsis character, use three periods with no space between them.
26.7 Exclamation points
Use exclamation points sparingly. Save them for when they count.
26.8 Periods
Don t use end punctuation in headlines, headings, subheadings, UI titles, UI links, or simple lists (three or fewer words per item).
End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words. Put one space, not two, after a period. 
Headline example Be brief make every word count
Text example Be brief. Make every word count.
For information about how to use periods in bulleted lists and numbered lists, see Lists.
When a phrase ending with a colon introduces a bulleted list:
* If one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every list element.
 
* If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don t end them with periods, even if they form a complete sentence together with the list introduction. 
* If one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element, even if a list element contains three or fewer words.
26.9 Question marks
Use questions sparingly. In general, customers want us to give them answers. 
When a customer needs to make a decision, a question is appropriate.
Examples
If you forgot your password, provide your secret answer. 
More nature themes are available online.
Do you want to save your changes?
26.10 Quotation marks
Use single quotation marks (   ) to indicate quoted material within a quotation. Double and single straight quotation marks can also be used to indicate feet and inches, respectively.  
Place closing quotation marks:
* Outside commas and periods.
* Inside other punctuation.
Exception If punctuation is part of the quoted material, place it inside the quotation marks.
Examples
One type of malware is called a  trojan clicker.  
He explained:  One type of malware, called a  trojan clicker,  uses your PC to  click  online ads.  
Use an 8.5  x 11  sheet of paper. 
Quotation marks in Segoe 

Use straight quotation marks (   ). Segoe Sans, the Microsoft font family, does not have a curly quotation mark option. For exceptions in print, use of Segoe Serif curly quotation marks is possible, but must be reviewed and approved by Microsoft Brand Studio.  
Preferred terms
Refer to quotation marks, opening quotation marks, and closing quotation marks. Don t call them quote marks, quotes, open or close quotation marks, or beginning or ending quotation marks. 
26.11 Semicolons
Sentences that contain semicolons are often complex. Try to simplify the sentence break it into multiple sentences or a list to eliminate the semicolon.
Use semicolons:
* Between two independent clauses that aren't joined by a conjunction.
Example Select Options; then select Automatic backups. 
* Between contrasting statements that aren't joined by a conjunction.
Example What s considered powerful changes over time; today s advanced feature might be commonplace tomorrow.
* To separate items in a series that contains commas or other punctuation. Even better, break out a complex series of items into a list.
Example In this tutorial, you ll learn how to construct an interface; implement both single-document interface and multiple-document interface applications; implement features that until now were considered difficult, such as printing, toolbars, scrolling, splitter windows, print preview, and context-sensitive Help; and take advantage of many built-in components of the class library.
Example In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
* Construct an interface.
* Implement both single-document interface and multiple-document interface applications.
* Implement features that until now were considered difficult, such as printing, toolbars, scrolling, splitter windows, print preview, and context-sensitive Help.
* Take advantage of many built-in components of the class library.
26.12 Slashes
When necessary, differentiate between a slash for URLs and a backslash for servers and folders.
When you instruct customers to enter a slash, always include the spelled-out term (backslash or slash) first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.
Example Enter two backslashes (\\) ....
See also 
Numbers
Special character term collection
URLs and web addresses
Use a slash:
* To imply a combination. Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. For example, if country/region is used as a label in a form, capitalize it as Country/Region.
Examples
client/server
TCP/IP
CD/DVD drive
Use the on/off switch to turn your mouse off when you're not using it.
Turn on the On/Off toggle.
* To separate parts of an internet address. Use two slashes after the protocol name. 
Example ftp://example.com/downloads
* In server, folder, and file names. 
Example \\mslibrary\catalog\collect.doc
* Between the numerator and denominator of fractions in equations that occur in text.
Examples
a/x + b/y = 1 
x + 2/3(y) = m
Don't use a slash as a substitute for or, like product/service. If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use or to describe the action in text.
Examples 
Select Automatic trapping to add or remove a check mark.
To turn the purchasing workflow on or off ....
Exception It's OK to use country/region and ZIP Code/postal code where space is limited.
See also 
and/or
country or region
either/or

26.13 @mentions
A feature that enables users to draw someone's attention to a message, comment, or calendar meeting or event by adding the @ symbol followed by the person's name to the body of the message or item. 
When this happens, the person is automatically notified that they were mentioned.
 
Example
@SanjibSahu, could you look at this?
27 Responsive content
If you re writing for the web, assume your content will be used on a variety of devices. Many websites today are responsive that is, they reconfigure automatically based on the device in use. Assume your content will be viewed at small sizes. 
27.1.1.1 Keep it short
Short text is always better, but on mobile devices, it s imperative. Try to write sentences and paragraphs that are short enough to read on a mobile screen without scrolling. It s hard to read a paragraph when you need to scroll to see the second half. 
Try to keep headings to one, short line. Two-line headings take up twice as much scarce vertical space. Use short words in headings, too, if you can. If a customer uses larger fonts to improve accessibility, long words may break across lines. 
Short sections headings and the text that follows are easier to read on small screens. Short sections also make it easier for customers to stop reading and later pick up where they left off. 
27.1.1.2 Use simple images, charts, and tables
Keep in mind that the width of your customer's screen may be just a couple of inches. Keep content simple so it s easy to read and understand. 
Choose simple images and crop extraneous detail. Always describe the image using alt text if it conveys useful information. 
Create infographics carefully. Provide a way for readers to open an infographic in an application where they can enlarge specific areas. Organize infographics in compact sections that readers can magnify and view on a small screen. Or, present individual sections of the infographic within text, and provide a link to the full infographic.
Simplify charts and graphs so readers can easily read the whole thing on a small screen. Craft very short chart titles, metrics labels, and axis labels. 
Limit the number of columns in tables and keep the text in each cell brief ideally one line. Tables with more than a few narrow columns may be hard to read. Too much text in a cell may cause a table to exceed the height of a mobile screen. 
27.1.1.3 Consider flow
As you create content, think about how it will flow on a 360-pixel screen. Typically, content on the right side of the page moves below content on the left side. Will the content still make sense?
Work with the designer or developer to determine where breaks in the content will occur, how much content displays at each potential resolution, and the order in which content will appear on small devices.
28 Scannable content
The volume of content available to customers is overwhelming. Part of a writer's job is to help readers find what they need quickly, or recognize just as quickly when they're not where they need to be. Writing to facilitate scanning will help.
Organize text into discrete components to support scanning. This section describes some of the methods you can use:
* Headings
* Lists
* Pull quotes
* Sidebars
* Tables
How you write is equally important to scanning.
28.1.1.1 Put first things first
Content on the first screen (also called above the fold) is the most likely to be read. Many readers won t scroll further without a compelling reason. So as always, keep it short, and lead with what s most important to the customer. Keep in mind that what appears above the fold varies by device and screen resolution.
Numerous studies have shown that readers look at specific areas of a page first. In left-to-right languages, people read in an F shape, giving the most attention to the upper-left corner of a page. Put your most important information there. Or try placing an offer or a Buy or Download button there. If the navigation is on the left, put your most important information in the upper-left corner of the text pane.
28.1.1.2 Be brief, be bold, be clear
Long spans of dense text are daunting and unapproachable to readers. Write short headings, short sentences, and short paragraphs that are easy to read and more visually appealing. 
1. Use short, simple words. 
2. Get to the point.
3. Then stop.
28.1.1.3 Include navigation within long documents
In general, keep web content short. When you have a great, customer-focused reason to create longer content, provide readers with at least one way to navigate within it, so they can quickly get to what they need. 
* If you're developing content for a collection, such as TechNet libraries, break the content up into sections so that information is easy to find in the library navigation.

* In a longer document that's likely to be read online, even if it s a downloadable Word document or PDF file, include a table of contents with links to subheadings. 

* Add Back to top links at the end of sections.
28.1.1.4 Establish patterns in content
Consistent writing, design, and formatting create patterns, which help readers comprehend more efficiently. Apply these tactics throughout your content to create familiar landmarks for your readers:
* Lead with what's most important. Place important keywords near the beginning of headings, table entries, and paragraphs so they're easy to spot. 

* Use text formatting consistently, such as using bold in procedures to identify UI labels. To learn more, see Text formatting. 

* Apply the same sentence structures to similar information. For example, use prepositional phrases consistently in procedures to help customers navigate menus and dialog boxes. And use the same syntax for cross-references and other common content elements.
Writing tip When comparing things, use parallel sentence structures to describe each thing. Write headlines and bulleted list items using the same sentence structure, too.
28.1.1.5 Give paragraphs room and keep them short
Paragraphs usually have extra space between them. How much extra space depends on the size of the font. The minimum is usually 50 percent of the line spacing, or at least half the font size. 
Short paragraphs, like this one, help to break up long passages of text. Three to seven lines is about the right length for a paragraph. 
It s also fine to have a single-line paragraph now and then. 
28.2 Headings
Headings provide both structure and visual points of reference to help readers scan content. If you can break text logically into smaller sections, the extra spacing and distinct fonts associated with headings will help readers scan content and find entry points.
In any type of content whether it's UI, web content, marketing, or advertising use headings consistently. 
28.2.1.1 Writing headings
Think of headings as an outline, only more interesting pithy, even. If readers don't read the headings, they probably won't read the text that follows, either. 
* Top-level headings communicate what's most important and divide content into major subjects. Make them as specific as you can to catch the reader's attention. 

* When there's a lot to say under a top-level heading, look for two or more distinct topics, and use second-level headings (subheads) to break up the large section into more scannable chunks. If you can't find at least two distinct topics, skip the second-level headings. 

* Avoid having two headings in a row without text in between that might indicate a problem with organization or that the headings are redundant. But don't insert filler text just to separate the headings. 

* Each new heading represents a new or more specific topic. The heading should introduce the topic in an interesting way.
Use headings judiciously. One heading level is usually plenty for a page or two of content. For long content, you might need to use additional heading levels. For example, this guide uses four heading levels.
Keep headings as short as possible, and put the most important idea at the beginning. This is especially critical in blogs and social media.
Be as specific as you can, and be even more detailed with lower-level headings. For example, a second-level heading should be more specific than a first-level heading.
Focus on what matters to customers, and choose words they'd use themselves. In most cases, don't talk about products, features, or commands in headings. Concentrate on what customers can achieve or what they need to know.
Use parallel sentence structure for all headings at the same level. For example, use noun phrases for first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level headings, and infinitive phrases for headings in instructions. 
Examples
Source data  
Prepare headings                
     To create a heading     
Scrub data                
     To remove blank rows 
PivotTable reports 
Report filters
Consider infinitive phrases, such as To create a heading, for headings and titles related to tasks. For headings that aren't related to tasks, use a noun phrase such as Headings, if possible. 
Don't use ampersands (&) or plus signs (+) in headings unless you're referring to UI that contains them or space is limited. 
Avoid hyphens in headings if you can. In resized windows or mobile devices, they can result in awkward line breaks.
Use vs., not v. or versus, in headings.
28.2.1.2 Formatting headings 
Use sentence-style capitalization for headings. That means that you capitalize the first word, any proper nouns, and the first word after a colon (if there is one). Everything else is lowercase. To learn more, see Capitalization.
Examples
Say hello to Surface Pro 
Set up the deployment environment 
Templates and themes for Office Online 
My account 
Find a store
Can a search engine predict the World Cup winner?
Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces
Don't end headings with a period. A question mark or (rarely) an exclamation point can be used if it's needed for meaning.
Examples
Not seeing what you want?

What can we help you find?
Use italic if it would be required in body text.
Break two-line headings carefully. Unless you're writing content for a responsive design (which breaks lines dynamically to fit the screen), break the heading in a way that makes sense and balances the length of the two lines. (Shift + Enter inserts a manual line break in many authoring tools.)
* Keep adjectives and prepositions with the words they modify. 

* Keep hyphenated words and multiple-word proper nouns (such as New York) on the same line. 

* Break after punctuation. 

* Break naturally, at the end of a complete phrase, if possible. 

* If you can't fit a headline on two lines, rewrite it.
Use vertical spacing to make headings stand out. Headings typically have extra space above them and often less space below them. Close proximity between the heading and the text that follows it communicates to the reader that they're related. Heading spacing is built into heading styles in most templates. Use those styles to control spacing in a consistent way. 
Don't use extra line breaks to increase heading spacing, especially in web content. In responsive web design, the layout and screen elements (including headings) adjust to the screen size automatically, whether they're viewed on mobile devices, tablets, laptops, or desktops. Extra line breaks might detract from the content appearance on mobile devices. 
Follow Microsoft Brand Guidelines for heading fonts. The heading font is often larger than the one used for body text. Sometimes it's a heavier weight or a different color. Done well, these distinct font treatments help attract users to the heading. Your template probably includes at least four heading styles. You don't have to, and usually shouldn't, use them all. 
If you don't have a template, limit yourself to no more than two fonts in headings (for example, Segoe UI Semibold and Segoe UI).

28.2.1.3 Using run-in headings
If you regularly highlight specific types of content, such as benefits, feature highlights, tips, notes, warnings, or cross-references, consider using a special kind of heading for them. Although they don't add white space to a document, bold run-in headings, like the ones you see in this article, draw the reader's eye to interesting information. Because they're part of the paragraph, run-in headings have less impact than separate headings but require much less space so they're ideal for packaging blurbs, web content, screen callouts, and the like. 
When you use bold formatting for run-in headings:
* Make sure the first few words of the paragraph are interesting and introduce the paragraph contents. 

* Consider repeating common phrases, such as Tip, Note, and See also, as run-in headings to call attention to helpful information, interesting but nonessential information, or cross-references, respectively.

* Use a character style, rather than manual formatting, to make your headings consistent, easy to apply, and easy to maintain. You can apply character styles to any selected words in a document without changing the paragraph style. In Microsoft Word, character styles, such as Subtle Emphasis, are designated by an a next to the style name. To create a new character style in a document, select the characters, and then add the style. 



28.3 Lists
Lists are a great way to present complex text in a way that's easy to scan.
A list should have at least two items but no more than seven items. Each item should be fairly short the reader should be able to see at least two, and preferably three, list items at a glance. It s OK to have a couple of short paragraphs in a list item, but don t exceed that length too often.
Make all the items in a list consistent in structure. For example, each item should be a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.
Bulleted lists
Use a bulleted list for things that have something in common but don t need to appear in a particular order.
Examples
The database owner can: 
* Create and delete a database.
* Add, delete, or modify a document.
* Add, delete, or modify any information in the database. 
Bring your customers into focus
* Own your customer relationship.
* Create raving fans.
* Engage in new ways.
Numbered lists
Use a numbered list for sequential items (like a procedure) or prioritized items (like a top 10 list). 
Example
To sign on to a database:
1. On the File menu, select Open database.
2. In Username, enter your name.
3. In Password, enter your password, and then select OK. 
Introductory text
 
Make sure the purpose of the list is clear. Introduce the list with a heading, a complete sentence, or a fragment that ends with a colon.
If you introduce a list with a heading, don t use explanatory text after the heading. Also, don t use a colon or period after the heading.
Global tip If your content will be localized, avoid lists where an introductory fragment is completed by the list items below it. This can be difficult to translate.
 
Capitalization 
Begin each item in a list with a capital letter unless there's a reason not to (for example, it s a command that's always lowercase). If necessary, rewrite the list item so that all items begin with capital letters or all items begin with lowercase words.
Punctuation
Don t use semicolons, commas, or conjunctions (like and or or) at the end of list items.
Don t use a period at the end of list items unless they re complete sentences, even if the complete sentence is very short.
Examples
Devices affected by this recall
* Original Surface Pro
* Surface Pro 2
* Surface Pro 3 
Limitations on meeting organizers
* Only invited?presenters can be selected as breakout room managers.
* The number of breakout room managers is limited to 10.
* Breakout room managers can't be assigned to specific rooms, but they can move freely between rooms.
If the list is introduced by a sentence fragment that ends with a colon, end all the items in the list with a period if any item forms a complete sentence when combined with the introduction.
Examples
Knowledge managers can:
* Confirm or remove topics that were discovered in your tenant.
* Create new topics manually as needed.
* Edit existing topic pages.
Exception Don t use periods if all items have three or fewer words or if the items are UI labels, headings, subheadings, strings, or similar types of text.
The administrative templates for Microsoft Edge are:
* msedge.admx
* msedgeupdate.admx
The topic answer will display:
* The topic name
* Alternate names
* The definition
 
In UI
Often lists are a series of radio buttons or checkboxes inside dialog boxes or settings pages. Unless they re complete sentences, don t use punctuation for each item in a list. If punctuation is necessary for clarity, make sure punctuation is used consistently in the list and in other lists within the same section or screen.
28.4 Pull quotes
Pull quotes are short sentences usually a quote from someone important to the story, but sometimes just a short, interesting sentence set off from body text to grab the reader s attention. 

Pull quotes should be short from a few words to a few lines. If the quote is from a person or publication, include the author s name, title, and organization with the pull quote.
Exception If the content is entirely about the person being quoted, you don t need to include the attribution.
Use pull quotes sparingly. If the quote is from a person or publication, make sure you have permission to use it in your content even if you're quoting someone who works for Microsoft. For legal information about using quotations, see Copyrights and trademarks.
28.5 Sidebars
Sidebars are useful in longer articles or documents to call out interesting sections and break up long spans of text. The content you put in a sidebar should be fairly short, interesting, and related but not crucial to the article. 
Typically people read sidebars before or after the rest of the page, so don t use sidebars for information that should be read in sequence with the main text.

28.6 Tables
Tables make complex information easier to understand by presenting it in a clear structure. In a table, data is arranged into two or more rows (plus a header row) and two or more columns. Don't use a table just to present a list of items that are similar. Use a list instead.
Tables are sometimes useful for
Example
Data or values
Text formats and their associated HTML codes
Simple instructions
User interface actions and their associated keyboard shortcuts
Categories of things with examples
SKUs and the products they include
Collections of things with two or more attributes
Event dates with times and locations
Table content
Make sure the purpose of the table is clear. If necessary, include a table title or brief introduction.
Place information that identifies the contents of a row in the leftmost column of the table. For example, in a table that describes commands, put the command names in the left column. 
Make entries in a table parallel. For example, make all the items within a column a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.
Example
Function
Description
AddUsersToEncryptedFile
Adds user keys to the specified encrypted file
Cancello
Cancels all pending input and output (I/O) operations that are issued by the calling thread for the specified file
CancelloEx

GetTempFileName
Creates a name for a temporary file
Don t leave an empty cell blank or use an em dash to indicate there s no entry or numerical data for that cell (sometimes referred to as a "null state"). Instead, use Not applicable or None. This helps people using screen readers find the information they're looking for. 
Keep responsive design in mind. Limit the number of columns and keep the text in each cell brief ideally one line. To learn more, see Responsive content.
Balance row height by increasing the width of text-heavy columns and reducing the width of columns with minimal text.
Table header rows
If the first row of your table contains column headers, you have a header row. Distinguish the text in the header row from the rest of the text in the table. For example, make it larger, bolder, or a different color.
Column headers identify the data each column contains. Make headers precise for usability. For example, don't use "Name". Instead, make column headers specific as in "Group" or "Employee". (While screen readers use header information to identify rows and columns, specificity helps all users find the information they're looking for.) 
Don t organize a table so that the column header forms a complete sentence when combined with the cell contents. This can make the table difficult to localize. 
In long tables, make sure the header row is always visible. For example, on the web, use a fixed header row that stays in place during scrolling. Or, in a downloadable document, occasionally repeat the header row. Some authoring tools provide a way to do this automatically. In Microsoft Word, select the header row. On the Layout tab under Table Tools, select Repeat Header Rows. 
Capitalization 
Use sentence-style capitalization for the table title and each column header. Use sentence-style capitalization for the text in cells unless there s a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be lowercase). 
Punctuation
If there s text that introduces the table, it should be a complete sentence and end with a period, not a colon.
Don t use ellipses at the end of column headers.
For the text in cells, use periods or other end punctuation only if the cells contain complete sentences or a mixture of fragments and sentences.

29 Search and writing
Customers find content in a variety of ways. One of the most common is search. Search engine optimization (SEO) tactics change rapidly, but good writing that addresses customer needs always helps. As you write, follow these guidelines to help customers find relevant content.
29.1.1.1 Keywords
Keywords are the terms customers use when they search for content. To help customers find your content in search engines, front-load keywords in headings, subheadings, and page descriptions.
The search terms that customers use aren't necessarily the same terms you would use when searching. So before you write, identify the keywords that you think customers will use to find your content. These resources can help: 
* Bing Keyword Research tool 
* Google Adwords Keyword Planner
* Google Analytics
When you ve identified the keywords that apply to your content, use them as early and as often as possible (without being contrived or repetitious) in these places:
* Titles 
* Headings and subheadings 
* Summaries 
* Overviews 
* Introductions 
* Page descriptions 
* Paragraph text 
* Link text 
* Image and table alt text 
If your content is video, audio, or images, include keywords in a nearby text description and in alt text. 
29.1.1.2 Links and backlinks
Linking to supporting information is a good way to stick to the point and keep content concise. In a large body of content, cross-references can improve navigation and make content easier to scan.
* Write short link text (four or fewer words) that's descriptive and includes keywords.
* If it works, use the title or description of the target page as link text. 
* Link to background and related information rather than summarizing it.
Backlinks are links from other online content to your page. Although search engine algorithms change frequently, backlinks are often part of the criteria that determine search ranking. As you plan, think about promotion and what other sites can appropriately link to your content. The more authoritative the site and the closer it maps to your keywords, the more weight the backlink carries. 
Never create backlinks just to improve your site's search ranking. Search practices that don t make sense for your content rarely work and often backfire.
30 Security, safety, and privacy content
Absolute security, privacy, and safety don't exist. When you write about those topics, be reassuring but realistic.
Don t make unconditional statements about security, safety, or privacy. Similarly, avoid images that might imply absolute security, safety, or privacy, such as padlocks, fortresses, vaults, and safes.  
When you write about these subjects, avoid absolute verbs, such as is, ensure, protect, promise, guarantee, or secure. Instead, talk about product features, technologies, and initiatives that help customers achieve security, safety, or privacy.
Examples

Outlook s antiphishing technology scans incoming mail automatically.
BitLocker encryption helps to protect your data.
Use qualifiers or self-comparisons with words like safe, private, privacy, secure, and their synonyms or derivatives. For example, add more, helps, can help, improve, or can improve. Direct comparison to competitors must be backed by evidence from cited sources. General self-comparisons to other Microsoft tools and products are OK.
Examples
Improve data security by deploying Microsoft Endpoint Protection technology.
BitLocker is a data protection feature that encrypts drives on your computer to help prevent data theft or exposure. 
Use location services more safely by adjusting your settings.
Stay safer online with business-grade security.

31 Text formatting
Type treatment is a key component in great design. The thoughtful use of fonts, text formatting, capitalization, alignment, and spacing creates a first impression, reinforces the Microsoft brand, and improves readability.
The consistent formatting of text elements, such as command names and URLs, reduces ambiguity and helps customers find and interpret information easily. Text-formatting guidelines are sometimes called document conventions.
This section covers:
* Using type
* Formatting common text elements
* Formatting titles

Procedures and instructions
Brand type guidelines (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
31.1 Using type
Beautiful typography is a cornerstone of modern design. The guidelines in this section will help you achieve it. 
* Use the Segoe font family
* Use sentence-style capitalization
* Use left alignment
* Don't compress line spacing
To learn more about using typography, see the brand type guidelines. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
31.1.1 Use the Segoe font family
The modern and readable Segoe font family makes communications feel like they come from Microsoft. Use Segoe UI fonts for all Microsoft on-screen and digital content. Use Segoe Pro for printed content. Don't use more than three font sizes on a page or in a document. 
To learn more about using Segoe, see the brand type guidelines. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)                      
Font 
Recommendation
Segoe UI Light
Use for text over 28 points online.
Segoe UI Semilight
Use sparingly. Get design advice, if possible, before using.
Segoe UI
Use for most body text, on-screen text, email, and UI text.
Segoe UI Semibold
Use for small text, text over backgrounds, or subheads.
Segoe UI (bold)
Use for subheads, but not for headlines and headings.
Segoe UI Black
Use sparingly. Get design advice, if possible, before using.
31.1.2 Use sentence-style capitalization
In sentence-style capitalization, you capitalize only the first word of a sentence or phrase and proper nouns. 
Example This sentence and the subhead of this section both use sentence-style capitalization. 
Don't use all-lowercase text. Capital letters help readers recognize that a new section or thought is beginning. All-lowercase text takes away that helpful cue. 
Example this sentence is all lowercase. or is it a sentence? it's hard to tell with no capital letters. 
Although all-uppercase text is used occasionally on webpages, in advertising, and in other marketing communications, don't use it in text. A mix of uppercase and lowercase characters gives words familiar shapes that help readers scan more efficiently. All-uppercase text just looks like a rectangle, so it's harder to read.
Example THIS SENTENCE IS ALL UPPERCASE AND NOT VERY EASY TO READ, DON'T YOU AGREE?
Learn more To learn more about proper nouns, see Nouns and pronouns. To learn more about capitalization, see Capitalization.
31.1.3 Use left alignment
Left-aligned text has an even left margin and an erratic (ragged) right margin. 
Don't center text. 
Avoid these awkward situations in text:
* Orphans, which occur when the first line of a paragraph appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column
* Widows, which occur when the last line of a paragraph contains only one word or appears alone on the next page or column
* Lines that end with hyphens
In Word and PowerPoint, you can manage these situations without using manual line breaks.
To
Do this
Keep a hyphenated word from breaking at the end of a line 
Insert a nonbreaking hyphen by pressing Ctrl+Shift+_. 
Keep the last word of a paragraph with the word that precedes it
Insert a nonbreaking space by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Space.
Control widows and orphans in Word 
Select a paragraph formatted with Normal style. On the context menu, select Styles > Apply Styles. In the Apply Styles pane, select Modify. Select Format > Paragraph. On the Line and page breaks tab, select Widow/Orphan control.
31.1.4 Don't compress line spacing
The amount of vertical space between lines of text in a paragraph, called line spacing, can help or hinder reading. Adequate line spacing helps readers find their way from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. 
If you re using a template, don t change the line spacing. If you re not, ask a designer for advice if you can. Otherwise, use the line spacing recommended in the brand type guidelines. (This document requires Microsoft network access.)
If you need to modify line spacing later, change it in the styles, not in individual paragraphs, so spacing remains consistent throughout the content. Never reduce line spacing to fit more text on a slide or page. Edit the text instead.
Font size
Line spacing
Body text (up to 14 points)
120% minimum
Subheadings (14 36 points)
110% minimum
Headings (36 points or larger)
120% maximum
31.2 Formatting common text elements
Consistent text formatting helps readers locate and interpret information. Follow these formatting conventions for common text elements.

31.3 Formatting titles
In general, use sentence-style casing (that is, only capitalize the first word of a title, like at the beginning of a sentence), as this makes content more readable and ensures better localizability. 
Use bold font instead of italics for titles to enhance readability and accessibility.  

There are some notable exceptions to sentence-casing. These include: 
* The titles of books (including e-books), white papers, and reports: 
Unraveling HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript  

Backup and Recovery Overview for Azure Customers 
* Games: 
Some of the top games on Microsoft Store include Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition and Stardew Valley. 
* Events and webinars:

32 UI text and content design
We need storytellers at the heart of product development. The UI is the most tactile, immediate, and visible way people interact with us and our most powerful tool for delivering great customer experiences. Ultimately, those great experiences are based on understanding our customers and tailoring experiences to their needs. 
32.1.1.1 Be simple, straightforward, and human
In products, we don t need more content we need content that does more. Content that s simple, straightforward, and human. 
Use these tips for writing in tight spaces.
* Get to the point fast. Start with the key takeaway. Make choices and next steps obvious. Provide customers with just enough information that they can make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word.

* Talk like a person. Use an informal, conversational tone like you re talking one-on-one.

* Keep it simple. Use simply structured, plain language. Write short sentences and fragments that are easy to scan and read. Break up complex information lead with what s most important, and create layers for any details that are critical to the task at hand. 
32.1.1.2 Put the customer at the center 
CEO Satya Nadella said,  Obsessing over our customers is everybody s job.  When you re writing UI, it s your job to know both your audience and how they experience the product. To better understand customer experiences:
* Live the brand like a customer. Use Microsoft products on every platform and device. Be curious and observant. Think about how the experience can be better.

* Reach out to your usability researchers. Use their insights to help your team identify and meet real customer needs. Watch customers in the lab now and then, too.
As you shape UI text, know the answers to these questions:
* Who is the customer? Will everyone see this screen? Or is it for advanced users only? 

* What is the customer trying to do? (This is different from, What do we want the customer to do?) Is this screen a step in a larger task or customer goal? A warning, an error, or a notification? 

* What is the customer s frame of mind? Are they wondering if something has gone wrong? Mad because they can't sign in? Confused about which option is best? Happy to have completed a task? Adjust your tone accordingly.
32.1.1.3 Design content for customer needs
Good content meets the customer's needs. Great content exceeds them. The words you choose should be easy to understand, have the right amount of information, and guide the customer to the right action for that person at that time. Here s a way to approach it:
1. Participate in the project kickoff. Your group likely has its own process for briefing teams on work items and developing conceptual flows. Get involved as far upstream as you can. Be an advocate for customers and meeting their needs.
2. Start with the why, continue with the how, and then move to the what. Early in the process, ignore the words and focus on the process flow from end to end. 
o Ask PMs for missing details about the scenario do you understand what's happening well enough to explain it? 
o Use the same questions that journalists rely on: who, what, when, where, why, and how.
o Sketch out or mock up the flow with your design partner and PM, and then discuss alternatives.
3. Temporarily set aside voice and style guidelines. You'll apply them later, but applying them too early may constrain creativity. With the mockup in hand, write preliminary content for each screen element. 
o Always write preliminary content or at least write draft text as a placeholder. 
o Don t use Greek text (lorem ipsum) as a placeholder. It conceals usability and design issues until late in the process, when they're harder to fix.
4. Provide enough information, but not too much. 
o Try to explain the scenario as if you're talking to a friend who s not particularly technical. Then read the real text aloud does it capture what you want to communicate? 
o Look for text that can be combined for brevity or separated to make it simpler. 
o Remove any details that aren t absolutely essential. 
5. Put yourself in your customer s shoes. What do they need to know? Did you explain it succinctly and clearly?
o If it s not clear how to do something, clarify it in the interface text. Consider showing examples. 
o If a task seems cumbersome, define the key tasks, break apart big decisions, prioritize features, and simplify customer interactions. 
o If it still doesn t seem like the task will be easy and intuitive for customers, consider bringing in your peers to review it for a fresh perspective. 
6. Apply Microsoft voice guidelines. Revise the content until the voice is conversational, clear, and concise. At each point in the task flow, map the tone to the customer's likely frame of mind. To learn more, see Brand voice.
7. Collaborate. Walk through your content with design and PM partners and peers to identify potential issues. Use their feedback in addition to insights gained from usability research to revise.
8. Apply style rules. When you're satisfied that the content is complete, check it against this guide, the brand voice guide (which requires Microsoft network access), and your group's editorial style guide to make sure it's ready for customers and consistent with other Microsoft brand experiences. 
o Make sure the content is easy to use and shows a high level of craft. 
o Pay attention to details like sentence-style capitalization and correct punctuation. To learn more, see Capitalization and Punctuation.
o For specifics on how to use brand and product names properly in UI, see the Microsoft brand guidelines for digital small spaces. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

33 URLs and web addresses
Communications to customers often refer to websites and URLs. Follow these guidelines to make your URL references clear and easy for customers to understand.
33.1.1.1 URL vs. address
In content for a general audience, use address rather than URL. In content for a technical audience, don't spell out URL on first mention. If you have a reason to spell out URL, use uniform resource locator.
Use a, not an, as an article preceding URL.
33.1.1.2 References to specific sites and domains
Don't include http:// or https:// in a URL. Include the protocol only if it's something other than HTTP, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP). 
Examples
www.microsoft.com/business
ftp://example.com/downloads/myfile.txt
The trailing slash at the end of a URL is optional. In most cases, leave it off. Never use a trailing slash in a URL that ends with a file name.
Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses. 
To refer to an entire website or top-level domain, such as Microsoft.com, omit http://www from the URL and capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently. 
Examples
www.microsoft.com
Microsoft.com 
Codeplex.com is home to the open-source project site hosted by Microsoft.
33.1.1.3 Grammar and formatting
Use of (not for) to describe the relationship of the word URL to a resource. Use the preposition at with the location of a specific address.
Examples
Search results include the URL of the page. 
Learn more about Microsoft products and services at www.microsoft.com.
If the reader might think the period at the end of a sentence is part of the URL, rewrite the sentence or set the URL off.
Examples
Go to windows.microsoft.com/upgrade to learn how to get your free Windows 10 upgrade. 
To get your free Windows 10 upgrade, go to our website:
    windows.microsoft.com/upgrade
Write brief but meaningful link text, using the title or a description of a page rather than a generic phrase like click here. In alt text for a graphic that links to another location, state clearly that the graphic is a link.
Examples
Go to the Windows 10 upgrade page to learn how to get your free upgrade. 
(Alt text) Picture of a woman talking on a phone that opens an online chat session with Microsoft support.
(Alt text) Windows 10 logo and link to the Windows 10 upgrade page.
34 Word choice
To improve readability and comprehension, choose your words wisely and use them consistently. If you mean the same thing, use the same word. 
This section provides tips for choosing the right words for the job:
* Use contractions
* Use simple words, concise sentences
* Don t use common words in new ways
* Use technical terms carefully
* Avoid jargon
* Use US spelling and avoid non-English words
For information about specific words and phrases, refer to the A Z word list, your group s editorial style guide, and Merriam-Webster Dictionary.
34.1 Use contractions
Write using the same, everyday words you use in conversation. 
* Use common contractions, such as it s, you re, that's, and don t, to create a friendly, informal tone. 
* Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don t use can't and cannot in the same UI.
* Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as Microsoft s developing a lot of new cloud services.
* Avoid ambiguous or awkward contractions, such as there d, it ll, and they d.
34.2 Use simple words, concise sentences
Make every word count. Concise, clear sentences save space, are easy to understand, and facilitate scanning. Use simple words with precise meanings, and remove words that don t add substance. Use your judgment to avoid sounding abrupt or unfriendly.
* Choose simple verbs without modifiers. Whenever you can, avoid weak or vague verbs, such as be, have, make, and do. 
Examples
Use this
Not this
use
utilize, make use of
remove
extract, take away, eliminate
tell
inform, let know
* Don t use two or three words when one will do. 
Examples                              
Use this
Not this
to
in order to, as a means to
also
in addition
connect
establish connectivity
* Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning. 
Examples                 
Use this
Not this
Because you created the table, you can change it.
Since you created the table, you can change it.
* Omit unnecessary adverbs words that describe how, when, or where. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out. 
Examples 
quite
very
quickly
easily
effectively
* Use one term consistently to represent one concept.
* Use words that can be both nouns and verbs carefully file, post, mark, screen, record, and report, for example. Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity. 
34.3 Don't use common words in new ways
Most people know the common definition of words usually the one that appears first in the dictionary (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, to be exact). Use words in the most familiar sense, or define them if you can't.
* Don t create a new word from an existing word. 
Example Don t use bucketize to mean group.
* Don't apply a new meaning to an ordinary word. 
Example Don t use graveyard to mean archive.
* Be careful with common words that have industry-specific uses. Assume customers know the common definition of the word, not the industry-specific definition. If you must use the industry-specific definition, define the word in context.
Writing tip Sometimes industry-specific usage, such as hacker,becomes part of everyday speech. Know your customer and the language they use. When in doubt, use a simple word with a well-understood meaning.

* Don t use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs. 
Examples
Use this
Not this
affect performance
impact performance
download the paper
get the download
respond to the request
respond to the ask
 
 
 
34.4 Use technical terms carefully
Technical terms come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're everyday words that are given new meanings, like cloud, batch, or dashboard. Other times, common words are combined to create technical terms, like telemedicine or email. Over time, some technical terms become widely understood, but before that happens, they can be confusing to people who aren't familiar with them. Use technical terms when they're the clearest way to communicate your message, but use them with care. 
34.4.1.1 Use common words whenever possible
Don't use a technical term when an everyday term will do. For example, don't use navigate to refer to moving from one website to another if you can use go or browse instead.
34.4.1.2 Don t assume everyone will understand technical terms
When you must use technical terms for precise communication, define them in context.
Use technical terms consistently
When you've decided to use a technical term, use that term consistently across products and services, tools, websites, and marketing communications. Aim for one term, one concept.
34.4.1.3 Use industry-specific terms for professional audiences 
Many industries and professions have their own terminology: banking, healthcare, construction, IT, and project management, for example.
If you're writing for an industry or profession, use the words your audience uses. First, verify Microsoft and industry usage. Check the A Z word list in this guide and your product group style guide, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, and your group's editorial style guide. Then look to authoritative industry resources: 
* Terminology websites, such as Webopedia.com, BusinessDictionary.com, and Whatis.TechTarget.com.
* Industry standard sites, such as W3C and IEEE.
* Industry research organizations, such as Forrester Research and Gartner. Check with the MS Library to learn more. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
* Domain books, such as the PMI Lexicon of Project Management Terms or the FDIC List of Abbreviations and Glossary of Terms (Appendix B). 
34.4.1.4 Don t create a new term if one already exists
Don't create a new term if an existing one serves your purpose. If you must create a new term, verify that it isn t already being used to mean something else.  
34.4.1.5 Research emerging terminology
Technology changes at light speed, and customers expect us to use the latest technical terms. But it's crucial to use them correctly and consistently across our products, services, documents, packaging, and marketing. Before you adopt a new term in your content, find out whether other groups are using it, and how. 
* First, check Merriam-Webster Dictionary,  and your group's editorial style guide.
* Get feedback from related product teams.
* Research the term on edited industry websites, such as Forrester Research, Gartner, CNET, Recode, Mashable, TechCrunch, WIRED, Gizmodo, HuffPost Tech, and Engadget. For emerging industry terminology, check reputable business and trade websites, such as Fast Company, Entrepreneur, Business Insider, Healthcare IT News, American Banker, and GameSpot. (Don t look for terminology usage guidance on Microsoft.com.)
* If it s a new name whether for a product or service, a feature, a campaign, an event, or an internal tool reach out to your product marketing team or engage in your group s established process for name development. Get a geopolitical review, and include legal and branding teams in the naming process. To learn more, see the Brand Central naming guidelines. (These sites require Microsoft network access.)
Global tip If possible, check Term Studio or contact your localization team to comment on any localization implications of new terms and usage. (Term Studio requires Microsoft network access.)
 
34.5 Avoid jargon
In the right context, for a particular audience, jargon serves as shorthand for well-understood concepts. But for less technical audiences, jargon can impede understanding.  
Don t use jargon if: 
* You can use a more familiar term, such as symbol instead of glyph. 
* The term is familiar to only a small segment of your readers. 
* The term isn't specific to software, networking, cloud services, and so on. 
Avoid business, marketing, and journalistic jargon, such as using leverage to mean take advantage of. 
Testing for jargon
Differentiating jargon from technical terminology is tricky. First, check the A Z word list and your group's editorial style guide. If you don t find the term, the following checklist can help.
* If you think a term is jargon, it probably is. 
* If it s an acronym or abbreviation, it may be jargon. Spell it out for clarity.
* If a reviewer questions your use of a term, it may be jargon.
* If the term is used in The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, or in general-interest magazines, such as Time or Newsweek, it might be appropriate for some audiences.
* If the term is used in technical periodicals such as CNET or TechCrunch, it's probably OK to use for technical audiences.
34.6 Use US spelling and avoid non-English words
When the spelling of English words varies by locale, use the US spelling. For example, use license, not licence.
Avoid non-English words or phrases, such as de facto or ad hoc. 
Avoid Latin abbreviations for common English phrases. 
Exception It s OK to use etc., in situations where space is limited. Otherwise, see and so on for alternatives.

With management at scale being the focal point of this hub, down the line you can also expect experiences such as security, compliance and policy views in a single pane across a customer’s entire Kubernetes portfolio. This hub addresses both Day 0 education and Day 100 operational efficiency that customers are expecting and already consuming in open-source tooling.  
The Kubernetes Hub is our next answer to a well-documented and urgent set of customer pain points in managing Kubernetes at scale. According to the 2024 Cloud Native Compute Foundation Annual Survey, 68% of organizations are running two or more Kubernetes clusters in production, and 21% operate more than ten. Yet, Azure’s current Portal experience remains siloed, forcing customers to manage each AKS cluster, Fleet, or namespace in isolation. This fragmentation drives customers to open-source tools like Rancher and Lens, or to build internal dashboards resulting in higher operational cost, increased risk, and a weakened Azure stickiness. For example, a conversation with PwC stated they spend over $4M a year just on Kubernetes tooling due to Azure Portals gaps. A recent State of Kubernetes report by Red Hat found that 57% of respondents cite infrastructure complexity as a major challenge, while lack of production readiness guidance delayed rollout for 43% of teams.
Kubernetes Hub directly addresses these gaps with a unified entry point in the Azure Portal that consolidates AKS Automatic, AKS, Azure Fleet Manager, and a new managed namespace resource under one surface. It offers production-grade setup guidance through a Dev-to-Prod checklist, where security misconfigurations and identity setup remain top sources of downtime in production environments. The Hub also introduces GPU-backed LLM deployment flows to meet the surging demand for AI infrastructure. CNCF’s 2024 AI/ML on Kubernetes Report shows that 72% of teams deploying ML workloads cite lack of GPU configuration support and model deployment complexity as their biggest blocker, problems the Kubernetes Hub will solve with curated LLM options and proper cluster configurations prepopulated. 
1.3 Customers and Business Impact 
Fleet Management and Multi-Cluster Insights 
Enterprise customers are seeking fleet-level management capabilities that abstract away individual cluster complexity. Morgan Stanley specifically wants capacity management, scaling, and SKU selection handled at the fleet level to eliminate per-cluster management overhead. There's a clear preference for seamless multi-cluster experiences over single large clusters, with specific requirements around scaling to 5,000 nodes with Cilium Network Policies while maintaining a 20% over-provisioning buffer based on industry recommendations. 
Scale and Consolidation Priorities 
While some potential customers like TGS are interested in GKE's 65,000-node clusters primarily to reduce the operational burden of managing multiple smaller clusters (currently 12), the core pain point is actually capacity planning and resource allocation across clusters. The challenge lies in identifying available cores and efficiently assigning them to users and jobs. These customers are looking to scale to at least 15,000 nodes with control-plane-light workloads, and consider upgrade management a solved problem through auto-upgrade capabilities. 
Cross-Cluster Workload Management 
For extremely large-scale deployments, providing a simplified jobs workload experience that spans multiple clusters could be more valuable than focusing solely on single-cluster scalability. This approach would be particularly appealing to customers like TGS who operate at massive scale. The ability to intelligently distribute and manage workloads across multiple clusters would eliminate the capacity planning headaches while maintaining operational efficiency without requiring enormous single-cluster implementations. 
Day 100 Enterprise & Day 0 Developer Generative Research 
Both startups and enterprises face significant challenges in resource optimization, though on different scales. Enterprises manage vast infrastructures and often rely on manual processes for resource tuning, driven by historical data and instinct. In contrast, startups balance limited resources with ambitious goals, manually optimizing their allocations to drive innovation and productivity. Cost optimization also varies; enterprises focus on cost-effective resource use while maintaining operational efficiency, whereas startups prioritize cost management to balance their limited resources with ambitious goals. 
Different teams build different dashboards, resulting in fragmented views of system health and success 
Resource tuning is manual, uneven, and full of uncertainty even among experienced teams 
Managing infrastructure at scale still requires human intervention at critical failure points 
Critical metrics drive decisions but accessing them across systems is messy and inconsistent 
The lack of standardization across platforms increases rework, learning curves, and cloud migration friction 
Unclear value propositions for AKS Automatic and Fleet Manager create confusion and may ultimately limit adoption 
1.4 Existing Solutions or Expectations 
Currently, customers have fragmented approaches across Portal to manage their Kubernetes clusters at scale: 
Individual cluster management: Navigate to each cluster individually in the Azure portal, requiring context switching and lacking cross-cluster visibility. Day 100 research indicates the portal is favored for ease of use, visual insights, and exploration. 
CLI-based management: Power users rely heavily on kubectl with context switching to manage multiple clusters. Research shows CLI is preferred for its efficiency, control, and automation capabilities. 
Azure Fleet Manager: A separate experience focused on fleet-wide management but not deeply integrated with other Kubernetes resources. Research indicates unclear value propositions create confusion and may ultimately limit adoption. 
Third-party solutions: Many customers rely on open-source tools like Rancher, Lens, or custom dashboards built with Grafana and Prometheus for observability. Research shows these result in duplicated efforts, inconsistent metrics, and misaligned perspectives across the organization. 
1.5 Goals 
Create a single pane of glass for all Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters to simplify the management experience for both IT Administrators and Developers  
Integrate Azure Fleet Manager for seamless multi-cluster management  
Provide at-a-glance health indicators (CPU, memory, errors, alerts) at the cluster browse level  
Enable seamless discovery of related services and cross-sell opportunities  
Support managed namespaces as first-class ARM resources with proper RBAC  
Provide quick AI/ML workload deployment landing-page experience with optimized GPU configurations  
Enhance accessibility to learning resources and documentation for Kubernetes management, ensuring users can quickly onboard and deepen their expertise. 
1.6 Proposed Solution
Approach: Aggregated at Scale experience, Fleet Integrated, Unified Experience 
"Announcing the Kubernetes Hub for Azure Portal. With Kubernetes Hub, you can now manage your entire Kubernetes estate through a unified resource experience, simplifying at scale management and helping you see the most important information across all your AKS clusters." 
Unified Multi-Cluster Dashboard (Summary) 
Most customers manage multiple clusters. Today, there is no built-in, scalable view of fleet-wide health. They use custom Prometheus setups, Grafana dashboards, or third-party tools. 
What It Is - A centralized, real-time view of: 
Total CPU, memory, and disk usage across all clusters
Top cluster issues by severity or frequency 
Policy/compliance gaps (e.g., out-of-date node pools, missing security settings) 
SLA awareness for Kubernetes versions 
Value: 
Adds immediate observability without extra setup [OOTB metrics without Prometheus resource type TBD] 
Encourages Fleet Manager for deeper insight and policy rollouts. 
Allows central SRE teams to more easily monitor SLAs and reduce unnecessary hurdles. 
Kubernetes Object Browser at Scale (All Resources) 
Today’s Portal is cluster centric. You must navigate into each individual AKS resource, making it unusable for large-scale operations or SRE workflows. 
What It Is - A powerful explorer UI that shows: 
All workloads (pods, deployments, jobs, services, etc.) 
Across multiple selected clusters 
Filter by cluster, object type, and namespace 
Value: 
Eliminates need for open-source dashboards like Lens. 
Makes Azure the default operational view. 
Drives usage across teams managing multiple environments (prod, staging, canary). 
Embedded Azure Fleet Manager 
What It Is - Fleet Manager is now contextually placed within the Hub instead of being a standalone, siloed resource. Users can view, configure, and scale Fleets alongside AKS clusters, set Fleet strategies and manage upgrades in one flow. 
Why This Matters - Fleet Manager adoption has been low due to poor discoverability and disjointed UX. Customers do not want to manage clusters, workloads, and fleets in separate areas. 
Value: 
Consolidates management into a single pane of glass. 
Opens cross-sell and upsell paths to Fleet for customers already using AKS. 
Encourages strategic features like workload placement, policy distribution, and versioning to be used at scale. 
Proposal: The Kubernetes Hub will provide a “Fleet-first” experience that encourages customers to adopt Azure Fleet Manager as the primary method for managing multiple clusters. This approach prioritizes Azure Fleet Manager adoption by making it the default paradigm for multi-cluster management, while still supporting individual cluster operations as needed. It directly addresses the enterprise research finding that there is unclear value proposition for Fleet Manager by making its benefits central to the experience: 
Unified experience:  
Automatic Fleet recommendations when multiple clusters are detected 
Seamless transition from individual to Fleet management in a unified UX 
Consistent management paradigms across all Kubernetes resources 
Managed namespaces as first-class ARM resources 
Individual cluster management as a subset:  
Access to individual clusters maintained but presented within Fleet upsell 
Simplified path to elevate individual clusters to Fleet management 
Consistent governance model regardless of management approach 
Detailed cluster-specific metrics and resources available OOTB 
In practice, this experience will seamlessly integrate Azure Fleet Manager and the Kubernetes Services portal UX, providing a cohesive management interface for Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters. 
Integrated Navigation Structure 
Fleet & Cluster Dashboard “Summary” - The entry point showing both fleet-level insights (from Fleet Manager) and cluster-specific metrics in a unified view. 
Resource Management - A consolidated TOC for managing resources that bridges the fleet management capabilities from Azure Fleet Manager with the granular Kubernetes resource controls from the Kubernetes services portal. 
Key Navigation Improvements 
Reduced Context Switching - Eliminates the need to switch between separate Fleet Manager and Kubernetes portals 
Consistent Terminology - Harmonizes terminology between the previously separate interfaces 
1.7 FAQ 
1. What is Kubernetes Hub and why is it being introduced? 
Kubernetes Hub is a unified management experience in the Azure Portal that brings together AKS, AKS Automatic, Azure Fleet Manager, and managed namespaces. It addresses long-standing customer pain points around fragmented cluster management, high operational overhead, and reliance on third-party tools. By consolidating these experiences, the Hub simplifies Kubernetes operations at scale and improves Azure stickiness. 
2. What metrics are available in the unified dashboard? 
The Kubernetes Hub dashboard provides out-of-the-box (OOTB) metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk utilization across clusters, along with top issues, policy gaps, and SLA version compliance. However, the availability and depth of these metrics depend on several architectural and implementation factors: 
High-level aggregated metrics (e.g., top 5 clusters by utilization) will be available to all users, but full fleet-wide observability requires Prometheus onboarding. This ensures access to detailed, real-time metrics across workloads and clusters. 
Aggregation of metrics across clusters is a critical dependency for ingesting and surfacing metrics at scale. TBD technical discussions between Monitoring and Fleet teams on the ingestion path approach to support scalable, queryable telemetry across both individual clusters and fleets. 
These dependencies are still under technical feasibility review, and discussions are ongoing to finalize performance expectations, SLAs, and fallback behaviors for non-Prometheus environments. 
3. Can I use Kubernetes Hub without onboarding to Fleet? 
Yes. Kubernetes Hub supports both Fleet and non-Fleet users. While Fleet users get full multi-cluster capabilities, non-Fleet users can still access individual cluster views and are encouraged to onboard via prominent “Add to Fleet” CTAs. The experience is designed to scale with the user's needs. 
4. What is the difference between Kubernetes Hub and Azure Fleet Manager? 
Kubernetes Hub is the entry point and unified interface for managing Kubernetes resources. Azure Fleet Manager is embedded within the Hub and provides the version orchestration and policy management for member clusters. The Hub elevates Fleet’s value by making it central to the user experience and improving its discoverability. 
5. What workloads and resources can I manage through Kubernetes Hub? 
With the Kubernetes object browser, users can see workloads (pods, deployments, jobs), services, managed namespaces, across all clusters. The Kubernetes Object Browser allows filtering by cluster, namespace, and resource type, making it ideal for SREs and developers managing multiple environments. 
6. How does Kubernetes Hub support AI/ML workloads? 
The Hub includes a GPU-backed deployment flow with curated LLM options (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, OpenAI) and optimized configurations. This addresses common blockers like GPU setup complexity and model deployment friction. While BYOM and tuning pipelines are out of scope for v1, this lays the foundation for future AI integrations. 
7. What are the onboarding options for new users? 
The “Get Started” tab offers a guided experience for both beginners and experienced users. It includes the Workloads Assistant, AKS offering comparisons, and a production-readiness checklist that audits key configurations across security, networking, cost, and resilience. 
8. How does Kubernetes Hub handle RBAC and IAM? 
RBAC is managed at both the cluster and Fleet levels using existing Azure IAM. The introduction of managed namespaces as ARM resources allows namespace-scoped users (e.g., developers) to access logs, deployments, and metrics directly in the Portal—without needing full cluster access. 
1.8 User Experience  
The resource menu in Kubernetes Hub is intentionally designed to unify fragmented experiences across AKS, Fleet Manager, and managed namespaces. By embedding Fleet-related actions and insights directly into the navigation (e.g., “All Resources,” “Managed Namespaces,” “Fleet Manager,” “Multi-Cluster Updates”), we eliminate the need for users to jump between disparate blades or tools. 
This structure ensures that: 
Fleet onboarding is discoverable and contextual: Users managing individual clusters are exposed to Fleet benefits through inline CTAs and upsell moments in the “All Resources” view. 
Fleet becomes the default mental model: By placing Fleet alongside core Kubernetes resources in the TOC, we shift user expectations from cluster-centric to fleet-centric management. 
Navigation is role-aware: IT admins and developers can access the same surface but see scoped views (e.g., namespace-level access for devs), reinforcing least-privilege access and usability. 
How It Contributes to Fleet Growth 
Frictionless Onboarding: The “Add to Fleet” button in the action bar of the cluster list view lowers the barrier to entry. Users can onboard clusters into Fleet without leaving the Hub. 
Fleet Visibility by Default: Even for non-Fleet users, the presence of Fleet-related menu items (e.g., “Fleet Manager,” “Multi-Cluster Updates”) introduces the concept early and often, increasing awareness and adoption. 
Progressive Disclosure: As users scale their Kubernetes footprint, the menu naturally guides them toward Fleet features that solve emerging pain points (e.g., policy rollout, version orchestration). 
How It Drives AKS Retention 
Users no longer need to toggle between the AKS blade, Fleet Manager, and third-party dashboards. Everything is accessible from a single, consistent menu. By consolidating operational views (e.g., Summary metrics, Object Browser, Managed Namespaces), the Hub becomes the default surface for day-to-day Kubernetes management. As users mature from managing a few clusters to operating at scale, the menu structure scales with them—offering deeper capabilities without requiring a new learning curve.
